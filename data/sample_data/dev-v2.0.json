                    "context": "Lloyd Webber started writing his own music at a young age , a suite of six pieces at the age of nine . He also put on \" productions \" with Julian and his Aunt Viola in his toy theatre ( which he built at Viola ' s suggestion ) . Later , he would be the owner of a number of West End theatres , including the Palace . His aunt Viola , an actress , took him to see many of her shows and through the stage door into the world of the theatre . He also had originally set music to Old Possum ' s Book of Practical Cats at the age of 15 . In 1965 , Lloyd Webber was a Queen ' s Scholar at Westminster School and studied history for a term at Magdalen College , Oxford , although he abandoned the course in Winter 1965 to study at the Royal College of Music and pursue his interest in musical theatre . Professional career Early years Lloyd Webber ' s first collaboration with lyricist Tim Rice was The Likes of Us , a musical based on the true story of Thomas John Barnardo . Although composed in 1965 , it was not publicly performed until 2005 , when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber ' s Sydmonton Festival . In 2008 , amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association ( NODA ) in association with the Really Useful Group . The first amateur performance was by a children ' s theatre group in Cornwall called \" Kidz R Us \" . Stylistically , The Likes of Us is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s ; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show , and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber ' s early influences , particularly Richard Rodgers , Frederick Loewe , and Lionel Bart . In this respect , it is markedly different from the composer ' s later work , which tends to be either predominantly or wholly through - composed , and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical .",

                    "context": "Lloyd Webber wrote a Requiem Mass dedicated to his father , William , who had died in 1982 . It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985 . Church music had been a part of the composer ' s upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read about the plight of Cambodian orphans . Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual Sydmonton Festival . Lloyd Webber received a Grammy Award in 1986 for Requiem in the category of best classical composition . Pie Jesu from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK pop charts . Perhaps because of its large orchestration , live performances of the Requiem are rare . Cricket ( 1986 ) , also called Cricket ( Hearts and Wickets ) , reunited Lloyd Webber with Tim Rice to create this short musical for Queen Elizabeth ' s 60th birthday , first performed at Windsor Castle . Several of the tunes were later used for Aspects of Love and Sunset Boulevard . Lloyd Webber also premiered The Phantom of the Opera in 1986 , inspired by the 1911 Gaston Leroux novel . He wrote the part of Christine for his then - wife , Sarah Brightman , who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside Michael Crawford as the Phantom . The production was directed by Harold Prince , who had also earlier directed Evita . Charles Hart wrote the lyrics for Phantom with some additional material provided by Richard Stilgoe , with whom Lloyd - Webber co - wrote the book of the musical . It became a hit and is still running in both the West End and on Broadway ; in January 2006 it overtook Cats as the longest - running musical on Broadway . On 11 February 2012 , Phantom of the Opera played its 10,000th show on Broadway . Aspects of Love followed in 1989 , a musical based on the story by David Garnett . The lyrics were by Don Black and Charles Hart and the original production was directed by Trevor Nunn . Aspects had a run of four years in London , but closed after less than a year on Broadway . It has since gone on a tour of the UK . 1990s Lloyd Webber was asked to write a song for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and composed \" Amigos Para Siempre \u2013 Friends for Life \" with Don Black providing the lyrics . This song was performed by Sarah Brightman and Jos\u00e9 Carreras .",

                    "context": "In 1968 , Rice and Lloyd Webber were commissioned to write a piece for the Colet Court preparatory school , which resulted in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat , a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiche a number of musical styles such as Elvis - style rock ' n ' roll , Calypso and country music . Joseph began life as a short cantata that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in The Times . For its subsequent performances , Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length . This culminated in a two - hour - long production being staged in the West End on the back of the success of Jesus Christ Superstar . In 1969 Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the Eurovision Song Contest called \" Try It and See , \" which was not selected . With rewritten lyrics it became \" King Herod ' s Song \" in their third musical , Jesus Christ Superstar ( 1970 ) . The planned follow - up to Jesus Christ Superstar was a musical comedy based on the Jeeves and Wooster novels by P. G. Wodehouse . Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture , partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired . After doing some initial work on the lyrics , he pulled out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical with Alan Ayckbourn , who provided the book and lyrics . Jeeves failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a short run of only three weeks . Many years later , Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project , producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled By Jeeves ( 1996 ) . Only two of the songs from the original production remained ( \" Half a Moment \" and \" Banjo Boy \" ) . Mid - 1970s Lloyd Webber collaborated with Rice once again to write Evita ( 1978 in London / 1979 in U.S. ) , a musical based on the life of Eva Per\u00f3n . As with Jesus Christ Superstar , Evita was released first as a concept album ( 1976 ) and featured Julie Covington singing the part of Eva Per\u00f3n . The song \" Do n ' t Cry for Me Argentina \" became a hit single and the musical was staged at the Prince Edward Theatre in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring Elaine Paige in the title role .",

It transferred to Broadway in 1979 . Rice and Lloyd Webber parted ways soon after Evita . In an interview in 2011 , LuPone commented \" He writes crap music ... Evita was his best score , Evita in its bizarreness - when I first heard it I thought ' I swear to God , he hated women ' [ ... ] There are some very romantic moments in his music , and there is some real ... trash that he does n ' t even think about parting with . He ' s not a very good editor of his own stuff . \" In 1978 , Lloyd Webber embarked on a solo project , the \" Variations \" , with his cellist brother Julian based on the 24th Caprice by Paganini , which reached number two in the pop album chart in the United Kingdom . The main theme was used as the theme tune for ITV ' s long - running South Bank Show throughout its 32 - year run . The same year , Lloyd Webber also composed a new theme tune for the long - running documentary series Whicker ' s World , which was used from 1978 - 80 . 1980s Lloyd Webber was the subject of This Is Your Life in November 1980 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the foyer of Thames Television ' s Euston Road Studios . He would be honoured a second time by the television programme in November 1994 when Michael Aspel surprised him at the Adelphi Theatre . Lloyd Webber embarked on his next project without a lyricist , turning instead to the poetry of T. S. Eliot . Cats ( 1981 ) was to become the longest running musical in London , where it ran for 21 years before closing . On Broadway , Cats ran for 18 years , a record which would ultimately be broken by another Lloyd Webber musical , The Phantom of the Opera . Starlight Express ( 1984 ) was a commercial hit , but received negative reviews from the critics . It enjoyed a record run in the West End , but ran for less than two years on Broadway . The show has also seen two tours of the US , as well as an Australian / Japanese production , a three - year UK touring production , which transferred to New Zealand later in 2009 . The show also runs full - time in a custom - built theatre in Bochum , Germany , where it has been running since 1988 .",

                    "context": "Lloyd Webber had toyed with the idea of writing a musical based on Billy Wilder ' s critically acclaimed movie , Sunset Boulevard , since the early 1970s when he saw the film , but the project did n ' t come to fruition until after the completion of Aspects of Love when the composer finally managed to secure the rights from Paramount Pictures , The composer worked with two collaborators , as he had done on Aspects of Love ; this time Christopher Hampton and Don Black shared equal credit for the book and lyrics . The show opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 12 July 1993 , and ran for 1,529 performances . In spite of the show ' s popularity and extensive run in London ' s West End , it lost money due to the sheer expense of the production . In 1994 , Sunset Boulevard became a successful Broadway show , opening with the largest advance in Broadway history , and winning seven Tony Awards that year . Even so , by its closing in 1997 , \" it had not recouped its reported $ 13 million investment . \" From 1995 - 2000 , Lloyd Webber wrote the Matters of Taste column in The Daily Telegraph where he reviewed restaurants and hotels , and these were illustrated by Lucinda Rogers . In 1998 , Lloyd Webber released a film version of \" Cats \" , which was filmed at the Adelphi Theatre in London . David Mallet directed the film , and Gillian Lynne choreographed it . The cast consisted of performers who had been in the show before , including Ken Page ( the original Old Deuteronomy on Broadway ) , Elaine Paige ( original Grizabella in London ) and Sir John Mills as Gus : the Theatre Cat . In 1998 Whistle Down the Wind made its debut , a musical written with lyrics supplied by Jim Steinman . Originally opening in Washington , Lloyd Webber was reportedly not happy with the casting or Harold Prince ' s production and the show was subsequently revised for a London staging directed by Gale Edwards , the production is probably most notable for the number - one hit from Boyzone \" No Matter What \" which left only the UK charts when the price of the CD single was changed to drop it out of the official top ten . His The Beautiful Game opened in London and has never been seen on Broadway . The show had a respectable run at The Cambridge Theatre in London . The show has been re - worked into a new musical , The Boys in the Photograph , which had its world premi\u00e8re at The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in April 2008 . 2000s",

The songwriter Ray Repp also claimed that Lloyd Webber stole a different melody from his own song \" Till You \" . Unlike Roger Waters , Ray Repp did decide to sue , but the court ruled in Lloyd Webber ' s favour . Personal life Lloyd Webber has married three times .

Entering Parliament in 1874 , Balfour achieved prominence as Chief Secretary for Ireland , in which position he suppressed agrarian unrest whilst taking measures against absentee landlords . He opposed Irish Home Rule , saying there could be no half - way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent . From 1891 he led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons , serving under his uncle , Lord Salisbury , whose government won large majorities in 1895 and 1900 . In July 1902 he succeeded Lord Salisbury as Prime Minister . He oversaw reform of British defence policy and the Entente Cordiale , an agreement with France that influenced Britain ' s decision to join the First World War . However , he was seen as an ambivalent personality and a weak Prime Minister . In 1905 he strongly supported stringent anti - immigration legislation , meant primarily to prevent Jewish immigrants fleeing the pogroms of Eastern Europe from entering the U.K . He cautiously embraced the imperial preference championed by Joseph Chamberlain , but resignations from the Cabinet left his party divided . He also suffered from public anger at the later stages of the Boer war ( counter - insurgency warfare characterized as \" methods of barbarism \" ) and the importation of Chinese labour to South Africa ( \" Chinese slavery \" ) . He resigned as Prime Minister in December 1905 and the following month the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 election , in which he lost his own seat . After re - entering Parliament at a by - election , he continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition throughout the crisis over Lloyd George ' s 1909 budget , the narrow loss of two further General Elections in 1910 , and the passage of the Parliament Act . He resigned as party leader later in 1911 .",

At an exhibition in August 1919 , it drew many criticisms ; the Commission ' s principal architect , Sir John Burnet , said Balfour ' s cross would create a criss - cross effect destroying any sense of \" restful diginity \" , Edwin Lutyens called it \" extraordinarily ugly \" , and its shape was variously described as resembling a shooting target or bottle . His design was not accepted but the Commission offered him a second chance to submit another design which he did not take up , having been refused once . After a further exhibition in the House of Commons , the \" Balfour cross \" was ultimately rejected in favour of the standard headstone the Commission permanently adopted because the latter offered more space for inscriptions and service emblems . Popular culture * Balfour was the subject of two parody novels based on Alice in Wonderland , Clara in Blunderland ( 1902 ) and Lost in Blunderland ( 1903 ) , which appeared under the pseudonym Caroline Lewis ; one of the co - authors was Harold Begbie . * The character Arthur Balfour plays a supporting , off - screen role in Upstairs , Downstairs , promoting the family patriarch , Richard Bellamy , to the position of Civil Lord of the Admiralty.. * Balfour was portrayed by Lyndon Brook in the 1975 ATV production Edward the Seventh . * A fictionalised version of Arthur Balfour ( identified as \" Mr. Balfour \" ) appears as British Prime Minister in the science fiction romance The Angel of the Revolution by George Griffith , published in 1893 ( when Balfour was still in opposition ) but set in an imagined near future of 1903 \u2013 1905 . * The indecisive Balfour ( identified as \" Halfan Halfour \" ) appears in a satirical short story by Saki in which he , and other leading politicians including Quinston , are changed into animals appropriate to their characters .

He continued to serve in senior Cabinet positions throughout the 1920s , and died on 19 March 1930 aged 81 , having spent a vast inherited fortune . He never married .

However as the power of the aristocracy waned during the 19th century the convention developed that the Prime Minister should always sit in the lower house . As leader of the House of Commons , the Prime Minister ' s authority was further enhanced by the Parliament Act of 1911 which marginalised the influence of the House of Lords in the law - making process . The Prime Minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service . Certain privileges , such as residency of 10 Downing Street , are accorded to Prime Ministers by virtue of their position as First Lord of the Treasury . Authority As the \" Head of Her Majesty ' s Government \" the modern Prime Minister leads the Cabinet ( the Executive ) . In addition the Prime Minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons ( the lower house of the legislature ) . As such the incumbent wields both legislative and executive powers . Under the British system there is a unity of powers rather than separation . In the House of Commons , the Prime Minister guides the law - making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party . In an executive capacity the Prime Minister appoints ( and may dismiss ) all other cabinet members and ministers , and co - ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments , and the staff of the Civil Service . The Prime Minister also acts as the public \" face \" and \" voice \" of Her Majesty ' s Government , both at home and abroad . Solely upon the advice of the Prime Minister , the Sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers , including high judicial , political , official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments ; the conferral of peerages , knighthoods , decorations and other honours . Although they may sometimes appear to be heavily under the influence of their aides , in reality the Prime Minister is in control . Constitutional background The British system of government is based on an uncodified constitution , meaning that it is not set out in any single document . The British constitution consists of many documents and , most importantly for the evolution of the office of Prime Minister , it is based on customs known as constitutional conventions that became accepted practice . In 1928 , Prime Minister H. H. Asquith described this characteristic of the British constitution in his memoirs :",

These offices , while offering few opportunities for distinction , were an apprenticeship . In early 1887 , Sir Michael Hicks Beach , the Chief Secretary for Ireland , resigned because of illness and Salisbury appointed his nephew in his place . That surprised the political world and possibly led to the British phrase \" Bob ' s your uncle ! \" . Balfour surprised critics by ruthless enforcement of the Crimes Act , earning the nickname \" Bloody Balfour \" . His steady administration did much to dispel his reputation as a political lightweight . In Parliament he resisted overtures to the Irish Parliamentary Party on Home Rule , and , allied with Joseph Chamberlain ' s Liberal Unionists , encouraged Unionist activism in Ireland . Balfour also helped the poor by creating the Congested Districts Board for Ireland in 1890 . In 1886 \u2013 1892 he became one of the most effective public speakers of the age . Impressive in matter rather than delivery , his speeches were logical and convincing , and delighted an ever wider audience . On the death of W.H . Smith in 1891 , Balfour became First Lord of the Treasury \u2013 the last in British history not to have been concurrently Prime Minister as well \u2013 and Leader of the House of Commons . After the fall of the government in 1892 he spent three years in opposition . When the Conservatives returned to power , in coalition with the Liberal Unionists , in 1895 , Balfour again became Leader of the House and First Lord of the Treasury . His management of the abortive education proposals of 1896 showed a disinclination for the drudgery of parliamentary management , yet he saw the passage of a bill providing Ireland with improved local government and joined in debates on foreign and domestic questions between 1895 and 1900 . During the illness of Lord Salisbury in 1898 , and again in Salisbury ' s absence abroad , Balfour was in charge of the Foreign Office , and he conducted negotiations with Russia on the question of railways in North China . As a member of the cabinet responsible for the Transvaal negotiations in 1899 , he bore his share of controversy and , when the war began disastrously , he was first to realise the need to use the country ' s full military strength . His leadership of the House was marked by firmness in the suppression of obstruction , yet there was a slight revival of the criticisms of 1896 . Prime Minister",

The prime minister ( informal abbreviation : PM ) and Cabinet ( consisting of all the most senior ministers , most of whom are government department heads ) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the Monarch , to Parliament , to their political party and ultimately to the electorate . The , Theresa May , leader of the Conservative Party , was appointed by the Queen on 13 July 2016 . The office is not established by any constitution or law but exists only by long - established convention , which stipulates that the monarch must appoint as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber . The position of Prime Minister was not created ; it evolved slowly and erratically over three hundred years due to numerous acts of Parliament , political developments , and accidents of history . The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective . The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement ( 1688 \u2013 1720 ) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament . Although the Sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government , politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a Prime Minister who could command a majority in Parliament . By the 1830s the Westminster system of government ( or cabinet government ) had emerged ; the Prime Minister had become primus inter pares or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom . The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties , the introduction of mass communication ( inexpensive newspapers , radio , television and the internet ) , and photography .

The new Prime Minister came into power practically at the same moment as the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra and the end of the South African War . The Liberal party was still disorganised over the Boers . The two chief items of the ministerial parliamentary programme were the extension of the new Education Act to London and the Irish Land Purchase Act , by which the British exchequer would advance the money for tenants in Ireland to buy land . An achievement of Balfour ' s government was establishment of the Committee on Imperial Defence . In foreign affairs , Balfour and his Foreign Secretary , Lord Lansdowne , improved relations with France , culminating in the Entente cordiale of 1904 . The period also saw the Russo - Japanese War , when Britain , an ally of the Japanese , came close to war with Russia after the Dogger Bank incident . On the whole , Balfour left the conduct of foreign policy to Lansdowne , being busy himself with domestic problems . Balfour distrusted the American concept of equality . During negotiations over creation of the League of Nations , the topic of \" all men being created equal \" came up in the context of the American Declaration of Independence . Speaking to Col. Edward M. House an aide to President Woodrow Wilson and David Hunter Miller , chief legal adviser to the US Commission , Balfour said \" that was an 19th century proposition that he did n ' t believe was true . He believed that it was true that in a sense all men in a particular nation were created equal , but not that a man in Central Africa was created equal to a European . \"",

Yet as events proved , it was the budget that would sow dissension , override other legislative concerns and signal a new political movement . Charles Thomson Ritchie ' s remission of the shilling import - duty on corn led to Joseph Chamberlain ' s crusade in favour of tariff reform . These were taxes on imported goods with trade preference given to the Empire , to protect British industry from competition , strengthen the Empire in the face of growing German and American economic power , and provide revenue , other than raising taxes , for the social welfare legislation . As the session proceeded , the rift grew in the Unionist ranks . Tariff reform was popular with Unionist supporters , but the threat of higher prices for food imports made the policy an electoral albatross . Hoping to split the difference between the free traders and tariff reformers in his cabinet and party , Balfour favoured retaliatory tariffs to punish others who had tariffs against the British , in the hope of encouraging global free trade . This was not sufficient for either the free traders or the extreme tariff reformers in government . With Balfour ' s agreement , Chamberlain resigned from the Cabinet in late 1903 to campaign for tariff reform . At the same time , Balfour tried to balance the two factions by accepting the resignation of three free - trading ministers , including Chancellor Ritchie , but the almost simultaneous resignation of the free - trader Duke of Devonshire ( who as Lord Hartington had been the Liberal Unionist leader of the 1880s ) left Balfour ' s Cabinet weak . By 1905 few Unionist MPs were still free traders ( Winston Churchill crossed to the Liberals in 1904 when threatened with deselection at Oldham ) , but Balfour ' s act had drained his authority within the government . Balfour resigned as Prime Minister in December 1905 , hoping the Liberal leader Campbell - Bannerman would be unable to form a strong government . This was dashed when Campbell - Bannerman faced down an attempt ( \" The Relugas Compact \" ) to \" kick him upstairs \" to the House of Lords . The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberals at the general election the following January ( in terms of MPs , a Liberal landslide ) , with Balfour losing his seat at Manchester East to Thomas Gardner Horridge , a solicitor and king ' s counsel . Only 157 Conservatives were returned to the Commons , at least two - thirds followers of Chamberlain , who chaired the Conservative MPs until Balfour won a safe seat in the City of London .",

Her death from cancer , at the height of her fame , was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public , which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death . The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster , Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist , and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office . She did not take up singing seriously until 1937 , when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist . Thereafter she took singing lessons , first with J.E . Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson . After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts ( CEMA ) , and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout England . In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent , who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency . She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues , and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts . In 1946 , Ferrier made her stage debut , in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten ' s opera The Rape of Lucretia . A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck ' s Orfeo ed Euridice , a work with which she became particularly associated . By her own choice , these were her only two operatic roles . As her reputation grew , Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures , including Britten , Sir John Barbirolli , Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore . She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe . Ferrier was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 1951 . In between periods of hospitalisation and convalescence she continued to perform and record ; her final public appearance was as Orfeo , at the Royal Opera House in February 1953 , eight months before her death . Among her many memorials , the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund was launched in May 1954 . The Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship Fund , administered by the Royal Philharmonic Society , has since 1956 made annual awards to aspiring young professional singers . Early life",

The Lancashire branch originated in the 19th century , when Thomas Ferrier ( youngest son of Private Thomas Ferrier of the Pembrokeshire Regiment ) settled in the area after being stationed near Blackburn during a period of industrial unrest.Cardus , pp . 19 \u2013 20 Kathleen Ferrier was born on 22 April 1912 , in the Lancashire village of Higher Walton where her father William Ferrier ( the fourth child of Thomas and Elizabeth , n\u00e9e Gorton ) was the head of the village school . Although untrained musically , William was an enthusiastic member of the local operatic society and of several choirs , and his wife Alice ( n\u00e9e Murray ) , whom he married in 1900 , was a competent singer with a strong contralto voice.Ferrier , pp . 14 \u2013 16 Kathleen was the third and youngest of the couple ' s children , following a sister and a brother ; when she was two the family moved to Blackburn , after William was appointed headmaster of St Paul ' s School in the town . From an early age Kathleen showed promise as a pianist , and had lessons with Frances Walker , a noted North of England piano teacher who had been a pupil of Tobias Matthay . Kathleen ' s talent developed quickly ; in 1924 she came fourth out of 43 entrants at the Lytham St Annes Festival piano competition , and in the following year at Lytham she achieved second place . Telephonist and pianist Because of William ' s impending retirement and the consequent fall in the family ' s income , Ferrier ' s hopes of attending a music college could not be realised . In August 1926 she left school to start work as a trainee at the GPO telephone exchange in Blackburn . She continued her piano studies under Frances Walker , and in November 1928 was the regional winner in a national contest for young pianists , organised by the Daily Express . Although unsuccessful in the London finals which followed , Ferrier won a Cramer upright piano as a prize . On 10 March 1929 she made a well - received appearance as an accompanist in a concert at Blackburn ' s King George ' s Hall . After further piano competition successes she was invited to perform a short radio recital at the Manchester studios of the BBC , and on 3 July 1930 made her first broadcast , playing works by Brahms and Percy Grainger . Around this time she completed her training and she became a fully fledged telephonist .",

Donations were received from all over the world . To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954 , at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment . Among the items was a rendition of Purcell ' s When I am laid in earth , which Ferrier had often sung ; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo cor anglais . The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital , in 1984. , it was continuing to fund oncology research . As the result of a separate appeal , augmented by the sales proceeds of a memoir edited by Neville Cardus , the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship Fund was created to encourage young British and Commonwealth singers of either sex . The Fund , which has operated from 1956 under the auspices of the Royal Philharmonic Society , initially provided an annual award covering the cost of a year ' s study to a single prizewinner . With the advent of additional sponsors , the number and scope of awards has expanded considerably since that time ; the list of winners of Ferrier Awards includes many singers of international repute , among them Felicity Palmer , Yvonne Kenny , Lesley Garrett and Bryn Terfel . The Kathleen Ferrier Society , founded in 1993 to promote interest in all aspects of the singer ' s life and work , has since 1996 awarded annual bursaries to students at Britain ' s major music colleges . The Society organised a series of events to commemorate the centenary of Ferrier ' s birth in 2012 . In February 2012 Ferrier was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the Royal Mail in the \" Britons of Distinction \" stamps set . Another was Frederick Delius . A biographic documentary film , Kathleen Ferrier , also known as ' was directed by Diane Perelsztejn and produced by ARTE France in 2012 . It featured interviews with her near relatives , friends and colleagues to produce a fresh view of her life and contributions to the arts . Kathleen Ferrier Crescent , in Basildon , Essex , is named in her honour . Recordings",

Her first appearance as a professional vocalist , in autumn 1937 , was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria . She was paid one guinea . After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival , Ferrier sang Ma Curly - Headed Babby in a concert at Workington Opera House . Cecil McGivern , producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show , was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme , which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939 . This broadcast \u2013 her first as a vocalist \u2013 attracted wide attention , and led to more radio work , though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February . Ferrier , pp . 39 \u2013 40 At the 1939 Carlisle Festival , Ferrier sang Richard Strauss ' s song All Soul ' s Day , a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators , J. E. Hutchinson , a music teacher with a considerable reputation . Ferrier became his pupil and , under his guidance , began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach , Handel , Brahms and Elgar . When Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940 , Ferrier reverted to her maiden name , having until then sung as ' Kathleen Wilson ' . In December 1940 she appeared for the first time professionally as ' Kathleen Ferrier ' in a performance of Handel ' s Messiah , under Hutchinson ' s direction . In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts ( CEMA ) , which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps , factories and other workplaces . Within this organisation Ferrier began working with artists with international reputations ; in December 1941 she sang with the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in a performance of Messiah together with Isobel Baillie , the distinguished soprano . However , her application to the BBC ' s head of music in Manchester for an audition was turned down.Fifield ( ed . ) , p. 17 Ferrier had better fortune when she was introduced to Malcolm Sargent after a Hall\u00e9 concert in Blackpool . Sargent agreed to hear her sing , and afterwards recommended her to Ibbs and Tillett , the London - based concert management agency .

Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth , the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary . The opera critic Rupert Christiansen , writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier ' s death approached , maintained that \" no singer in this country has ever been more deeply loved , as much for the person she was as for the voice she uttered \" . Her death , he continued , \" quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation \" ( which had taken place on 2 June 1953 ) . Ian Jack , editor of Granta , believed that she \" may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen . \" Among the many tributes from her colleagues , that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers : \" The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler \u2013 in that order . \" Very few singers , Lord Harewood writes , \" have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague . \" At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon , in his eulogy , said of Ferrier ' s voice : \" She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world . \" From time to time commentators have speculated on the directions Ferrier ' s career might have taken had she lived . In 1951 , while recovering from her mastectomy , she received an offer to sing the part of Brang\u00e4ne in Wagner ' s opera Tristan und Isolde at the 1952 Bayreuth Festival . According to Christiansen she would have been \" glorious \" in the role , and was being equally sought by the Bayreuth management to sing Erda in the Ring cycle . Christiansen further suggests that , given the changes of style over the past 50 years , Ferrier might have been less successful in the 21st century world : \" We dislike low - lying voices , for one thing \u2013 contraltos now sound freakish and headmistressy , and even the majority of mezzo - sopranos should more accurately be categorised as almost - sopranos \" . However , she was \" a singer of , and for , her time \u2013 a time of grief and weariness , national self - respect and a belief in human nobility \" . In this context \" her artistry stands upright , austere , unfussy , fundamental and sincere \" .",

At Leeds in November 1944 she sang the part of the Angel in Elgar ' s choral work The Dream of Gerontius , her first performance in what became one of her best - known roles . In December she met John Barbirolli while working on another Elgar piece , Sea Pictures ; the conductor later became one of her closest friends and strongest advocates . On 15 September 1945 Ferrier made her debut at the London Proms , when she sang L ' Air des Adieux from Tchaikovsky ' s opera The Maid of Orleans . Although she often sang individual arias , opera was not Ferrier ' s natural forte ; she had not enjoyed singing the title role in a concert version of Bizet ' s Carmen at Stourbridge in March 1944 , and generally avoided similar engagements . Nevertheless , Benjamin Britten , who had heard her Westminster Abbey Messiah performance , persuaded her to create the role of Lucretia in his new opera The Rape of Lucretia , which was to open the first postwar Glyndebourne Festival in 1946 . She would share the part with Nancy Evans.Britten , pp . 83 \u2013 85 Despite her initial misgivings , by early July Ferrier was writing to her agent that she was \" enjoying [ the rehearsals ] tremendously and I should think it ' s the best part one could possibly have \" . Ferrier ' s performances in the Glyndebourne run , which began on 12 July 1946 , earned her favourable reviews , although the opera itself was less well received . On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses . By contrast , when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier ' s performance . This was Ferrier ' s first trip abroad , and she wrote an excited letter to her family : \" The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see , and flowers in the fields all the way ! \" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947 , to sing Orfeo in Gluck ' s opera Orfeo ed Euridice . She had often sung Orfeo ' s aria Che far\u00f2 ( \" What is life \" ) as a concert piece , and had recently recorded it with Decca . At Glyndebourne , Ferrier ' s limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor , Fritz Stiedry ; nevertheless her performance on the first night , 19 June 1947 , attracted warm critical praise .",

Outward appearances were maintained for a few years , until Wilson ' s departure for military service in 1940 effectively ended the marriage .

                    "context": "Warner Bros. launched an extensive marketing campaign to promote the picture and to establish Bacall as a movie star . As part of the public relations push , Bacall made a visit to the National Press Club in Washington , D.C. , on February 10 , 1945 . It was there that Bacall ' s press agent , chief of publicity at Warner Bros. Charlie Enfield , asked the 20 - year - old Bacall to sit on the piano while U.S. Vice President Harry S. Truman played . After To Have and Have Not , Bacall was seen opposite Charles Boyer in Confidential Agent ( 1945 ) , which was poorly received by critics . By her own estimation , it could have caused considerable damage to her career , had her performance as the mysterious , acid - tongued Vivian Rutledge in Hawks ' s film noir The Big Sleep ( 1946 ) , co - starring Bogart , not provided a quick career resurgence . The Big Sleep laid the foundation for her status as an icon of film noir . She would be strongly associated with the genre for the rest of her career , and would often be cast as variations of the independent and sultry femme fatale character of Vivian she played in the movie . As described by film scholar Joe McElhaney , \" Vivian displays an almost total command of movement and gesture . She never crawls . \" Bacall was cast with Bogart in two more films . In Dark Passage ( 1947 ) , another film noir , she played an enigmatic San Francisco artist . \" Miss Bacall - - generates quite a lot of pressure as a sharp - eyed , knows - what - she - wants girl \" , wrote Bosley Crowther of The New York Times of her performance . And , in 1948 , she was in John Huston ' s melodramatic suspense film Key Largo with Bogart and Edward G. Robinson . In the film , according to film critic Jessica Kiang , \" Bacall brings an edge of ambivalence and independence to the role that makes her character much more interesting than was written . \" 1950s Bacall turned down scripts she did not find interesting , and thereby earned a reputation for being difficult . Despite this , she further solidified her star status in the 1950s by appearing as the leading lady in a string of films that won favorable reviews . Bacall was cast opposite Gary Cooper in Bright Leaf ( 1950 ) . In the same year , she played a two - faced femme fatale in Young Man with a Horn ( 1950 ) , a jazz musical co - starring Kirk Douglas , Doris Day , and Hoagy Carmichael .",

He changed her first name to Lauren , and she chose \" Bacall \" ( a variant of her mother ' s maiden name ) as her screen surname . Slim Hawks also took Bacall under her wing , dressing Bacall stylishly and guiding her in matters of elegance , manners and taste . At Hawks ' suggestion , Bacall was also trained to make her voice lower and deeper instead of her normal high - pitched , nasal voice . Hawks had her , under the tutelage of a voice coach , lower the pitch of her voice . As part of her training , she was required to shout verses of Shakespeare for hours every day . Her 5 feet , 8\u00bd inches , height , unusual among young female actors in filmmaking in the 1940s and 1950s also helped her stand out . Her voice was characterized as a \" smoky , sexual growl \" by most critics , and a \" throaty purr \" . During her screen tests for To Have and Have Not ( 1944 ) , Bacall was so nervous that , to minimize her quivering , she pressed her chin against her chest , faced the camera and tilted her eyes upward . This effect , which came to be known as \" The Look \" , became another Bacall trademark along with her sultry voice . Bacall ' s character in the film used Slim Hawks ' nickname \" Slim \" , and Bogart used Howard Hawks ' nickname \" Steve \" . The on - set chemistry between the two was immediate according to Bacall . She and Bogart ( who was married at the time to Mayo Methot ) began a romantic relationship several weeks into shooting . Bacall ' s role in the script was originally much smaller , but during filming her part was revised multiple times to extend it into the lead part that it became in the released film . Once released , To Have and Have Not catapulted Bacall into instant stardom , and her performance became the cornerstone of her star image , the impact of which extended into popular culture at large , even influencing fashion , as well as film makers and other actors .",

In 1953 she starred in the CinemaScope comedy How to Marry a Millionaire , a runaway hit among critics and at the box office . Directed by Jean Negulesco and co - starring Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable , Bacall got positive notices for her turn as the witty gold - digger , Schatze Page . \" First honors in spreading mirth go to Miss Bacall \" , wrote Alton Cook in The New York World - Telegram & Sun . \" The most intelligent and predatory of the trio , she takes complete control of every scene with her acid delivery of viciously witty lines . \" After the success of How to Marry a Millionaire , she was offered , but declined , with Bogart ' s support , the coveted invitation from Grauman ' s Chinese Theatre to press her hand - and footprints in the theatre ' s cemented forecourt . But she felt at the time that \" anyone with a picture opening could be represented there , standards had been so lowered . \" She did n ' t feel she had yet achieved the status of a major star , and was thereby unworthy of the honor : \" I want to feel I ' ve earned my place with the best my business has produced . \" At the time , Bacall was still under contract to 20th Century Fox . Following How to Marry a Millionaire , she appeared in yet another CinemaScope comedy directed by Jean Negulesco , Woman ' s World ( 1954 ) , which failed to match its predecessor ' s success at the box office . In 1955 a television version of Bogart ' s breakthrough film , The Petrified Forest , was performed as a live installment of Producers ' Showcase , a weekly dramatic anthology , featuring Bogart as Duke Mantee , Henry Fonda as Alan , and Bacall as Gabrielle , the part originally played in the 1936 movie by Bette Davis . Bogart had originally played the part on Broadway with the subsequent movie ' s star Leslie Howard , who had secured a film career for Bogart by insisting that Warner Bros. cast him in the movie instead of Edward G. Robinson ; Bogart and Bacall named their daughter \" Leslie Howard Bogart \" in gratitude . In the late 1990s , Bacall donated the only known kinescope of the 1955 performance to The Museum Of Television & Radio ( now the Paley Center for Media ) , where it remains archived for viewing in New York City and Los Angeles .",

Directed by Vincente Minnelli , The Cobweb takes place at a mental institution in which Bacall ' s character works as a therapist . It was her second collaboration with Charles Boyer and also starred Richard Widmark and Lillian Gish . \" In the only two really sympathetic roles , Mr. Widmark is excellent and Miss Bacall shrewdly underplays \" , wrote The New York Times . Many film scholars consider Written on the Wind , directed by Douglas Sirk in 1956 , to be a landmark work in the melodrama genre . Appearing with Rock Hudson , Dorothy Malone and Robert Stack , Bacall played a career woman whose life is unexpectedly turned around by a family of oil magnates . Bacall wrote in her autobiography that she did not think much of the role , but reviews were favorable . Wrote Variety , \" Bacall registers strongly as a sensible girl swept into the madness of the oil family \" . While struggling at home with Bogart ' s battle with esophageal cancer , Bacall starred with Gregory Peck in Designing Woman to solid reviews . The musical comedy was her second feature with director Vincente Minnelli and was released in New York on May 16 , 1957 , four months after Bogart ' s death on January 14 . Bacall appeared in two more films in the 1950s : the Jean Negulesco - directed melodrama The Gift of Love ( 1958 ) , which co - starred Robert Stack ; and the adventure film North West Frontier ( 1959 ) , which was a box office hit . 1960s and 1970s Bacall ' s movie career waned in the 1960s , and she was seen in only a handful of films . She starred on Broadway in Goodbye , Charlie in 1959 , and went on to have a successful on - stage career in Cactus Flower ( 1965 ) , Applause ( 1970 ) , and Woman of the Year ( 1981 ) . She won Tony Awards for her performances in the latter two . Applause was a musical version of the film All About Eve , in which Bette Davis had starred as stage diva Margo Channing . According to Bacall ' s autobiography , she and a girlfriend won an opportunity in 1940 to meet her idol Bette Davis at Davis ' s hotel . Years later , Davis visited Bacall backstage to congratulate her on her performance in Applause . Davis told Bacall , \" You ' re the only one who could have played the part . \"",

Joe was also said to have verbally abused his son , often saying that he had a \" fat nose \" . Jackson stated that he was physically and emotionally abused during incessant rehearsals , though he credited his father ' s strict discipline with playing a large role in his success . In an interview with Martin Bashir for the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson , Jackson recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed , and that \" if you did n ' t do it the right way , he would tear you up , really get you . \" Jackson ' s parents have disputed the longstanding allegations of abuse , with Katherine stating that while whipping is considered abuse today , it was a common way to discipline children at the time . Jackie , Tito , Jermaine and Marlon have also said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings , which were harder on Michael because he was younger , kept them disciplined and out of trouble . Speaking openly about his childhood in an interview with Oprah Winfrey broadcast in February 1993 , Jackson acknowledged that his youth had been lonely and isolating . His deep dissatisfaction with his appearance , his nightmares and chronic sleep problems , his tendency to remain hyper - compliant , especially with his father , and to remain childlike throughout his adult life are consistent with the effects of the maltreatment he endured as a young child .",

It is the highest mountain in Africa , and rises approximately 4,900 m ( 16,000 ft ) from its base to above sea level . The first recorded ascent to the summit of the mountain was by Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller in 1889 . The mountain is part of the Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major climbing destination . The mountain has been the subject of many scientific studies because of its shrinking glaciers . Geology and physical features Kilimanjaro rises approximately 4,900 m ( 16,000 ft ) from its southern base in the plains near the municipality of Moshi to its summit height of 5895 m. Kilimanjaro is the highest volcano outside South America . Kilimanjaro is a large stratovolcano and is composed of three distinct volcanic cones : Kibo , the highest ; Mawenzi at ; and Shira , the shortest at . Mawenzi and Shira are extinct , while Kibo is dormant and could erupt again . Uhuru Peak is the highest summit on Kibo ' s crater rim . The Tanzania National Parks Authority , a governmental agency , and the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization list the height of Uhuru Peak as . That height is based on a British Ordnance Survey in 1952 . Since then , the height has been measured as in 1999 , in 2008 , and in 2014 . The interior of the volcanic edifice is poorly known , given the lack of large scale erosion that could have exposed the interiors of the volcano . Eruptive activity at the Shira centre commenced about 2.5 million years ago , with the last important phase occurring about 1.9 million years ago , just before the northern part of the edifice collapsed . Shira is topped by a broad plateau at 3800 m , which may be a filled caldera . The remnant caldera rim has been degraded deeply by erosion . Before the caldera formed and erosion began , Shira might have been between 4,900 m ( 16,000 ft ) and 5,200 m ( 17,000 ft ) high . It is mostly composed of basic lavas with some pyroclastics . The formation of the caldera was accompanied by lava emanating from ring fractures , but there was no large scale explosive activity . Two cones formed subsequently , the phonolitic one at the northwest end of the ridge and the doleritic \" Platzkegel \" in the caldera centre . Both Mawenzi and Kibo began erupting about 1 million years ago . They are separated by the \" Saddle Plateau \" at 4400 m elevation .",

Parts of the country are in Southern Africa . It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north ; Rwanda , Burundi , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west ; Zambia , Malawi , and Mozambique to the south ; and by the Indian Ocean to the east . Kilimanjaro , Africa ' s highest mountain , is in northeastern Tanzania .

Dar es Salaam , the former capital , retains most government offices and is the country ' s largest city , principal port , and leading commercial centre . European colonialism began in mainland Tanzania during the late 19th century when Germany formed German East Africa , which gave way to British rule following World War I . The mainland was governed as Tanganyika , with the Zanzibar Archipelago remaining a separate colonial jurisdiction . Following their respective independence in 1961 and 1963 , the two entities merged in April 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanzania . Etymology The name \" Tanzania \" was created as a clipped compound of the names of the two states that unified to create the country : Tanganyika and Zanzibar . The name \" Tanganyika \" is derived from the Swahili words tanga ( \" sail \" ) and nyika ( \" uninhabited plain \" , \" wilderness \" ) , creating the phrase \" sail in the wilderness \" . It is sometimes understood as a reference to Lake Tanganyika . The name of Zanzibar comes from \" zengi \" , the name for a local people ( said to mean \" black \" ) , and the Arabic word \" barr \" , which means coast or shore . History Pre - colonial The indigenous populations of eastern Africa are thought to be the click speaking Hadza and Sandawe hunter - gatherers of Tanzania .",

Similarly , Krapf wrote that a chief of the Wakamba people , whom he visited in 1849 , \" had been to Jagga and had seen the Kima jaJeu , mountain of whiteness , the name given by the Wakamba to Kilimanjaro ... . \" More correctly in the Kikamba language , this would be Kiima Kyeu , and this possible derivation has been popular with several investigators . Others have assumed that \" Kilima \" is Kiswahili for \" mountain \" . The problem with this assumption is that \" Kilima \" actually means \" hill \" and is , therefore , the diminutive of \" Mlima \" , the proper Kiswahili word for mountain . However , \" [ i ] t is ... possible ... that an early European visitor , whose knowledge of [ Kiswahili ] was not extensive , changed mlima to kilima by analogy with the two Wachagga names ; Kibo and Kimawenzi . \" A different approach is to assume that the \" Kileman \" part of Kilimanjaro comes from the Kichagga \" kileme \" , which means \" which defeats \" , or \" kilelema \" , which means \" which has become difficult or impossible \" . The \" Jaro \" part would \" then be derived from njaare , a bird , or , according to other informants , a leopard , or , possibly from jyaro a caravan . \" Considering that the name Kilimanjaro has never been current among the Wachagga people , it is possible that the name was derived from Wachagga saying that the mountain was unclimbable , \" kilemanjaare \" or \" kilemajyaro \" and porters misinterpreted this as being the name of the mountain . In the 1880s , the mountain became a part of German East Africa and was called \" Kilima - Ndscharo \" in German following the Kiswahili name components . On 6 October 1889 , Hans Meyer reached the highest summit on the crater ridge of Kibo . He named it \" Kaiser - Wilhelm - Spitze \" ( \" Kaiser Wilhelm peak \" ) . That name apparently was used until Tanzania was formed in 1964 , when the summit was renamed \" Uhuru \" , meaning \" Freedom Peak \" in Kiswahili .

Based on linguistic evidence , there may also have been two movements into Tanzania of Eastern Cushitic people at about 4,000 and 2,000 years ago , originating from north of Lake Turkana . Archaeological evidence supports the conclusion that Southern Nilotes , including the Datoog , moved south from the present - day South Sudan / Ethiopia border region into central northern Tanzania between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . These movements took place at approximately the same time as the settlement of the iron - making Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas . They brought with them the west African planting tradition and the primary staple of yams . They subsequently migrated out of these regions across the rest of Tanzania between 2,300 and 1,700 years ago . Eastern Nilotic peoples , including the Maasai , represent a more recent migration from present day South Sudan within the past 1,500 to 500 years . The people of Tanzania have been associated with the production of iron and steel . The Pare people were the main producers of highly demanded iron for peoples who occupied the mountain regions of northeastern Tanzania . The Haya people on the western shores of Lake Victoria invented a type of high - heat blast furnace , which allowed them to forge carbon steel at temperatures exceeding 1820 C more than 1,500 years ago . Travellers and merchants from the Persian Gulf and India have visited the east African coast since early in the first millennium A.D. Islam was practised by some on the Swahili Coast as early as the eighth or ninth century A.D . Colonial In 1498 , the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama visited the Tanzanian coast . Later , in 1506 , the Portuguese succeeded in controlling most of the Southeast African littoral . In 1699 , the Portuguese were ousted from Zanzibar by Omani Arabs . Claiming the coastal strip , Omani Sultan Seyyid Said moved his capital to Zanzibar City in 1840 . During this time , Zanzibar became the centre for the Arab slave trade . Between 65 % and 90 % of the population of Arab - Swahili Zanzibar was enslaved . One of the most infamous slave traders on the East African coast was Tippu Tip , who was himself the grandson of an enslaved African . The Nyamwezi slave traders operated under the leadership of Msiri and Mirambo . According to Timothy Insoll , \" Figures record the exporting of 718,000 slaves from the Swahili coast during the 19th century , and the retention of 769,000 on the coast . \"",

They reach as far as Lake Chala and Taveta in the southeast and the Lengurumani Plain in the northwest . Most of these cones are well preserved , with the exception of the Saddle Plateau cones that were heavily affected by glacial action . Despite their mostly small size , lava from the cones has obscured large portions of the mountain . The Saddle Plateau cones are mostly cinder cones with terminal effusion of lava , while the Upper Rombo Zone cones mostly generated lava flows . All Saddle Plateau cones predate the last glaciation . According to reports gathered in the 19th century from the Maasai , Lake Chala on Kibo ' s eastern flank was the site of a village that was destroyed by an eruption . The mountain is drained by a network of rivers and streams , especially on the wetter and more heavily eroded southern side and especially above 1200 m. Below that altitude , increased evaporation and human water usage reduces the waterflows . The Lumi and Pangani rivers drain Kilimanjaro on the eastern and southern sides , respectively . Name The origin of the name \" Kilimanjaro \" is not precisely known , but a number of theories exist . European explorers had adopted the name by 1860 and reported that \" Kilimanjaro \" was the mountain ' s Kiswahili name . The 1907 edition of The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia also records the name of the mountain as \" Kilima - Njaro \" . Johann Ludwig Krapf wrote in 1860 that Swahilis along the coast called the mountain \" Kilimanjaro \" . Although he did not support his claim , he claimed that \" Kilimanjaro \" meant either \" mountain of greatness \" or \" mountain of caravans \" . Under the latter meaning , \" Kilima \" meant \" mountain \" and \" Jaro \" possibly meant \" caravans \" . Jim Thompson claimed in 1885 , although he also did not support his claim , that the term Kilima - Njaro \" has generally been understood to mean \" the Mountain ( Kilima ) of Greatness ( Njaro ) . \" Though not improbably it may mean \" the \" White \" mountain .",

The post \u2013 World War I accords and the League of Nations charter designated the area a British Mandate , except for the Kionga Triangle , a small area in the southeast that was incorporated into Portuguese East Africa ( later Mozambique ) . During World War II , about 100,000 people from Tanganyika joined the Allied forces and were among the 375,000 Africans who fought with those forces . Tanganyikans fought in units of the King ' s African Rifles during the East African Campaign in Somalia and Abyssinia against the Italians , in Madagascar against the Vichy French during the Madagascar Campaign , and in Burma against the Japanese during the Burma Campaign . Tanganyika was an important source of food during this war , and its export income increased greatly compared to the pre - war years of the Great Depression Wartime demand , however , caused increased commodity prices and massive inflation within the colony . In 1954 , Julius Nyerere transformed an organisation into the politically oriented Tanganyika African National Union ( TANU ) . TANU ' s main objective was to achieve national sovereignty for Tanganyika . A campaign to register new members was launched , and within a year TANU had become the leading political organisation in the country . Nyerere became Minister of British - administered Tanganyika in 1960 and continued as prime minister when Tanganyika became independent in 1961 . Post - colonial British rule came to an end on 9 December 1961 , but for the first year of independence , Tanganyika had a governor general who represented the British monarch . On 9 December 1962 , Tanganyika became a democratic republic under an executive president . After the Zanzibar Revolution overthrew the Arab dynasty in neighbouring Zanzibar , which had become independent in 1963 , the archipelago merged with mainland Tanganyika on 26 April 1964 . On 29 October of the same year , the country was renamed the United Republic of Tanzania ( \" Tan \" comes from Tanganyika and \" Zan \" from Zanzibar ) . The union of the two hitherto separate regions was controversial among many Zanzibaris ( even those sympathetic to the revolution ) but was accepted by both the Nyerere government and the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar owing to shared political values and goals . In 1967 , Nyerere ' s first presidency took a turn to the left after the Arusha Declaration , which codified a commitment to socialism as well - as Pan - Africanism . After the declaration , banks and many large industries were nationalised .",

Mawenzi forms a horseshoe shaped ridge with pinnacles and ridges opening to the northeast which has a tower like shape resulting from deep erosion and a mafic dyke swarm . Several large cirques cut into the ring , the largest of these sits on top of the Great Barranco gorge . Also notable are the Ost and West Barrancos on the northeastern side of the mountain . Most of the eastern side of the mountain has been removed by erosion . Mawenzi has a subsidiary peak named Neumann Tower ( 4425 m ) . Kibo is the largest cone and is more than 15 mi wide at the \" Saddle Plateau \" altitude . The last activity here has been dated to between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago and created the current Kibo summit crater . Kibo still has gas - emitting fumaroles in the crater . Kibo is capped by an almost symmetrical cone with escarpments rising 180 m to 200 m on the south side . These escarpments define a caldera caused by the collapse of the summit . Within this caldera is the Inner Cone and within the crater of the Inner Cone is the Reusch Crater , which the Tanganyika government in 1954 named after Gustav Otto Richard Reusch upon his climbing the mountain for the 25th time ( out of 65 attempts during his lifetime ) . The Ash Pit , 350 m deep , lies within the Reusch Crater . About 100,000 years ago , part of Kibo ' s crater rim collapsed , creating the area known as the Western Breach and the Great Barranco . An almost continuous layer of lavas buries most older geological features , with the exception of exposed strata within the Great West Notch and the Kibo Barranco . The former exposes intrusions of syenite . Kibo has five main lava formations : * phono - tephrites and tephri - phonolites of the \" Lava Tower group \" , on a dyke cropping out at 4600 m , 482,000 years ago * Tephri - phonolite to phonolite lavas \" characterized by rhomb mega - phenocrysts of sodic feldspars \" of the \" Rhomb Porphyry group \" , 460,000 \u2013 360,000 years ago * aphyric phonolite lavas , \" commonly underlain by basal obsidian horizons \" , of the \" Lent group \" , 359,000 \u2013 337,000 years ago * porphyritic tephri - phonolite to phonolite lavas of the \" Caldera rim group \" , 274,000 \u2013 170,000 years ago * phonolite lava flows with aegirine phenocrysts , of the \" Inner Crater group \" , which represents the last volcanic activity on Kibo",

This flag represented Libya from its independence in 1951 to 1969 , and was adopted by the pro - democracy movement during the Libyan civil war . An excerpt from the memoirs of Adrian Pelt states , \" during deliberations of the Libyan National Constitutional Convention , a paper drawing of a proposed national flag was presented to the convention by Omar Faiek Shennib ( distinguished member of the delegation from Cyrenaica ) . The design was composed of three colors ; red , black and green , with a white Crescent and Star centered in the middle black stripe . Mr. Shennib informed the delegates that this design had met the approval of His Highness Emir of Cyrenaica , King Idris Al Senussi ( later to become King of Libya ) .

Before 1911 , the Ottoman vilayet of Tripolitania ( the \" kingdom of Tripoli \" ) included much of the same territory as modern Libya . Tripolitania The short - lived Tripolitanian Republic in western Libya had its own flag , which had a light blue field and a green palm tree in the center , with a white star on top of it . It was unilaterally declared in 1918 and claimed sovereignty over the entire former vilayet , but never had full de facto governance . Italian Libya ( 1934 \u2013 1943 ) From 1934 to 1943 , Libya was an Italian colony and used the flag of the Kingdom of Italy .

In Libya , green was also a colour traditionally used to represent the Tripolitania region . State of Libya ( 2011 ) During the Libyan Civil War against the rule of Muammar Gaddafi , the 1951 \u2013 1969 flag \u2013 as well as various makeshift versions without the crescent and star symbol , or without the green stripe \u2013 came back into use in areas held by the Libyan opposition and by protesters at several Libyan diplomatic missions abroad . The National Transitional Council , formed on 27 February 2011 , adopted the flag previously used in the Kingdom of Libya between 1951 and 1969 as the \" emblem of the Libyan Republic \" . The flag was officially defined in article three of the Libyan Draft Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage : The national flag shall have the following shape and dimensions : Its length shall be double its width , its shall be divided into three parallel coloured stripes , the uppermost being red , the centre black and lowest green , the black stripe shall be equal in area to the other two stripes together and shall bear in its centre a white crescent , between the two extremities of which there shall be a five\u2011pointed white star . The flag was initially used by protesters during the Libyan Civil War . On 10 March 2011 , France was the first country to recognize the council as the official government of Libya , as well as the first to allow the Libyan embassy staff to raise the flag . On 21 March , the flag was flown by the Permanent Mission of Libya to the United Nations and appeared on their official website , and thereafter in late August by the Arab League and by Libya ' s own telecommunications authority , the Libya Telecom & Technology , on its own website . In the following months many other Libyan embassies replaced the green flag of Gaddafi with the tricolor flag . This original flag of Libya is now the only flag used by the United Nations to represent Libya , according to the following UN statement : \" Following the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 66 / 1 , the Permanent Mission of Libya to the United Nations formally notified the United Nations of a Declaration by the National Transitional Council of 3 August 2011 changing the official name of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to \" Libya \" as well as a decision to change Libya ' s national flag to the original . \" All Libyan diplomatic posts , such as embassies and consulates , use the original flag of Libya .

The term flag is also used to refer to the graphic design employed , and flags have since evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification , especially in environments where communication is similarly challenging ( such as the maritime environment where semaphore is used ) . National flags are potent patriotic symbols with varied wide - ranging interpretations , often including strong military associations due to their original and ongoing military uses . Flags are also used in messaging , advertising , or for other decorative purposes . The study of flags is known as vexillology , from the Latin word vexillum , meaning flag or banner . Due to the use of flags by military units , ' flag ' is also used as the name of some military units . A flag ( Arabic : \u0644\u0648\u0627\u0621 ) is equivalent to a brigade in Arab countries , and in Spain , a flag ( Spanish : bandera ) is a battalion - equivalent in the Spanish Legion . History In antiquity , field signs or standards were used in warfare that can be categorized as vexilloid or ' flag - like ' . Examples include the Sassanid battle standard Derafsh Kaviani , and the standards of the Roman legions such as the eagle of Augustus Caesar ' s Xth legion , or the dragon standard of the Sarmatians ; the latter was let fly freely in the wind , carried by a horseman , but judging from depictions it was more similar to an elongated dragon kite than to a simple flag . During the High Middle Ages flags came to be used primarily as a heraldic device in battle , allowing more easily to identify a knight than only from the heraldic device painted on the shield . Already during the high medieval period , and increasingly during the Late Middle Ages , city states and communes such as those of the Old Swiss Confederacy also began to use flags as field signs . Regimental flags for individual units became commonplace during the Early Modern period . During the peak of the age of sail , beginning in the early 17th century , it was customary ( and later a legal requirement ) for ships to carry flags designating their nationality ; these flags eventually evolved into the national flags and maritime flags of today . Flags also became the preferred means of communications at sea , resulting in various systems of flag signals ; see , International maritime signal flags .",

A heraldic coat of arms may also be flown as a banner of arms , as is done on both the state flag of Maryland and the flag of Kiribati . The de jure flag of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi , which consisted of a rectangular field of green , was for a long period the only national flag using a single colour and no design or insignia . However , other historical states have also used flags without designs or insignia , such as the Soviet Republic of Hungary , whose flag was a plain field of red . Colours are normally described with common names , such as \" red \" , but may be further specified using colourimetry . The largest flag flown from a flagpole worldwide , according to Guinness World Records , is the flag of Mexico flown in Piedras Negras , Mexico . This flag was about 2058 m2 . The largest flag ever made was the flag of Qatar ; the flag , which measures at , was completed in December 2013 in Doha . Parts of a flag The general parts of a flag are : canton \u2013 the upper inner section of the flag ; field or ground \u2013 the entire flag except the canton , and the field and hoist ends ; fly end \u2013 the furthest edge from the hoist end ; and hoist end \u2013 the edge used to attach the flag to the hoist . Vertical flags Vertical flags are sometimes used in lieu of the standard horizontal flag in central and eastern Europe , particularly in the German - speaking countries . This practice came about because the relatively brisk wind needed to display horizontal flags is not common in these countries . The standard horizontal flag ( no . 1 in the preceding illustration ) is nonetheless the form most often used even in these countries . The vertical flag ( German : Hochformatflagge or Knatterflagge ; no . 2 ) is a vertical form of the standard flag . The flag ' s design may remain unchanged ( No . 2a ) or it may change , e.g . by changing horizontal stripes to vertical ones ( no . 2b ) . If the flag carries an emblem , it may remain centered or may be shifted slightly upwards . The vertical flag for hoisting from a beam ( German : Auslegerflagge or Galgenflagge ; no . 3 ) is additionally attached to a horizontal beam , ensuring that it is fully displayed even if there is no wind .",

It is an administrative , cultural and economic centre . Niamey ' s population , which was estimated at 774,235 in 2006 , is now projected to be much higher . The city is located in a pearl millet growing region , while manufacturing industries include bricks , ceramic goods , cement and weaving . History Niamey was probably founded in the eighteenth century , but was of little importance to most of the country until the French developed a colonial post in the 1890s . This rapidly grew into an important centre . In 1926 it became the capital of Niger , and the population gradually increased , from about 3,000 in 1930 to around 30,000 in 1960 . The period from 1970 to 1988 was one in which the economy of Niger boomed , driven by revenue from the uranium mines at Arlit . In this period , the population of Niamey grew from 108,000 to 398,365 inhabitants . The city expanded from 1367 ha in 1970 to 4400 ha by 1977 , in the process annexing peripheral villages such as Lazaret . By some estimates the population had reached 800,000 in 2000 . In 2011 , government press estimated the total urban population at over 1.5 million . A major cause of the increase has been in migration for work and during droughts , as well a high population growth . This last factor means a majority of the city ' s citizens are youths . Geography and climate Covering an area of over 250 km2 , the metropolitan area sits atop two plateaus reaching 218 m in altitude , bisected by the Niger River . At Niamey , the river , running almost straight SSE from Gao , makes a series of wide bends . The city was founded on the east ( \" left bank \" ) of the river as it meanders from a west to east flow to run almost directly south . A series of marshy islands begin at Niamey and extend south in the river .",

Several hospitals are located in Niamey , including the CURE H\u00f4pital des Enfants au Niger , National Hospital and Lamord\u00e9 University Hospital . In December 2005 , it was the host of the Jeux de la Francophonie . Niamey makes up a special capital district of Niger , which is surrounded by the department of Tillab\u00e9ri . Niamey hosts the African Centre of Meteorological Application for Development . Religion More than 90 % of Niger is populated by Muslims . Niamey hosts the largest mosque in the country , the Grand Mosque of Niamey . Within Christianity , the city is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Niamey . There is also a small Bah\u00e1 ' \u00ed community in Niamey . Governance Overview The city of Niamey itself is governed as an autonomous first - level administrative block , the Niamey Urban Community ( fr . Communaut\u00e9 Urbaine de Niamey , CUN ) . It includes five Urban Communes , divided into 44 \" Districts \" and 99 \" Quartiers \" , including formerly independent towns . It is a co - equal first division subdivision with the seven Regions of Niger . The Niamey Urban Community includes an administration and Governor appointed by national leaders . Like the rest of Niger , Niamey has seen a decentralisation of governance since 2000 . Government Ordinance n \u00b0 2010 \u2013 56 and Presidential Decree n \u00b0 2010 - 679 of September 2010 mandated an elected City Council for the city of Niamey , subsumed under the CUN . This excludes some outlying areas of the CUN . Forty - five councillors are popularly elected and in turn elect the Mayor of the City of Niamey . In July 2011 the first Mayor under the new system , Oumarou Dogari Moumouni , was installed by the Governor of the CUN Mrs. A\u00efchatou Boulama Kan\u00e9 and the City Council . The City Council and Mayor have limited roles compared the CUN Governor . Niamey has a third layer of government in the Commune system . Each Commune elects its own council , and outside major cities , these function like independent cities . Niamey and other major cities have been , since the advent of decentralisation , developing co - ordination of Commune governments in large cities made up of multiple Communes .",

                    "context": "There is no fixed length for a musical . While it can range from a short one - act entertainment to several acts and several hours in length ( or even a multi - evening presentation ) , most musicals range from one and a half to three hours . Musicals are usually presented in two acts , with one short intermission and the first act frequently longer than the second . The first act generally introduces nearly all of the characters and most of the music , and often ends with the introduction of a dramatic conflict or plot complication while the second act may introduce a few new songs but usually contains reprises of important musical themes and resolves the conflict or complication . A book musical is usually built around four to six main theme tunes that are reprised later in the show , although it sometimes consists of a series of songs not directly musically related . Spoken dialogue is generally interspersed between musical numbers , although \" sung dialogue \" or recitative may be used , especially in so - called \" sung - through \" musicals such as Jesus Christ Superstar , Les Mis\u00e9rables , and Evita . Several shorter musicals on Broadway and in the West End have been presented in one act in recent decades . Moments of greatest dramatic intensity in a book musical are often performed in song . Proverbially , \" when the emotion becomes too strong for speech you sing ; when it becomes too strong for song , you dance . \" In a book musical , a song is ideally crafted to suit the character ( or characters ) and their situation within the story ; although there have been times in the history of the musical ( e.g . from the 1890s to the 1920s ) when this integration between music and story has been tenuous . As New York Times critic Ben Brantley described the ideal of song in theatre when reviewing the 2008 revival of Gypsy : \" There is no separation at all between song and character , which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be . \" Typically , many fewer words are sung in a five - minute song than are spoken in a five - minute block of dialogue . Therefore , there is less time to develop drama in a musical than in a straight play of equivalent length , since a musical usually devotes more time to music than to dialogue . Within the compressed nature of a musical , the writers must develop the characters and the plot .",

The story and emotional content of a musical \u2013 humor , pathos , love , anger \u2013 are communicated through the words , music , movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole . Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance , it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue , movement and other elements . Since the early 20th century , musical theatre stage works have generally been called , simply , musicals . Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times , modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century , with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America . These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan . The Princess Theatre musicals and other smart shows like Of Thee I Sing ( 1931 ) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat ( 1927 ) and Oklahoma ! ( 1943 ) . Some of the most famous and iconic musicals through the decades that followed include West Side Story ( 1957 ) , The Fantasticks ( 1960 ) , Hair ( 1967 ) , A Chorus Line ( 1975 ) , Les Mis\u00e9rables ( 1985 ) , The Phantom of the Opera ( 1986 ) , Rent ( 1996 ) , The Producers ( 2001 ) , Wicked ( 2003 ) and Hamilton ( 2015 ) .

Comparisons with opera Musical theatre is closely related to the theatrical form of opera , but the two are usually distinguished by weighing a number of factors . Musicals generally have a greater focus on spoken dialogue ( though some musicals are entirely accompanied and sung through ; and on the other hand , some operas , such as Die Zauberfl\u00f6te , and most operettas , have some unaccompanied dialogue ) ; on dancing ( particularly by the principal performers as well as the chorus ) ; on the use of various genres of popular music ( or at least popular singing styles ) ; and on the avoidance of certain operatic conventions . In particular , a musical is almost always performed in the language of its audience . Musicals produced on Broadway or in the West End , for instance , are invariably sung in English , even if they were originally written in another language . While an opera singer is primarily a singer and only secondarily an actor ( and rarely needs to dance ) , a musical theatre performer is often an actor first and then a singer and dancer . Someone who is equally accomplished at all three is referred to as a \" triple threat \" . Composers of music for musicals often consider the vocal demands of roles with musical theatre performers in mind . Today , large theatres staging musicals generally use microphones and amplification of the actors ' singing voices in a way that would generally be disapproved of in an operatic context .",

The name Operation Valkyrie , originally referring to a component part of the conspirators ' overall plot , has become associated with the event . The apparent purpose of the assassination attempt was to seize political control of Germany and its armed forces from the Nazi Party ( including the SS ) in order to obtain peace with the western Allies as soon as possible . The underlying desire of many of the involved high ranking Wehrmacht officers was apparently to show to the world that not all Germans were like Hitler and the Nazi Party . The details of the conspirators ' peace initiatives remain unknown , but they likely would have included demands to accept wide - reaching territorial annexations by Germany in Europe . The plot was the culmination of the efforts by several groups in the German Resistance to overthrow the Nazi - led German government . The failure of both the assassination and the military coup d ' \u00e9tat which was planned to follow , led to the arrest of at least 7,000 people by the Gestapo . According to records of the F\u00fchrer Conferences on Naval Affairs , 4,980 of these were executed . Background Since 1938 , conspiratorial groups planning an overthrow of some kind had existed in the German Army ( Wehrmacht Heer ) and in the German Military Intelligence Organization ( Abwehr ) . Early leaders of these plots included Brigadier - General Hans Oster , General Ludwig Beck and Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben . Oster was the deputy head of the Military Intelligence Office . Beck was a former Chief - of - Staff of the German Army High Command ( Oberkommando des Heeres , OKH ) . Von Witzleben was the former commander of the German 1st Army and the former Commander - in - Chief of the German Army Command in the West ( Oberbefehlshaber West , or OB West ) . They soon established contacts with several prominent civilians , including Carl Goerdeler , the former mayor of Leipzig , and Helmuth James Graf von Moltke , the great - grandnephew of the hero of the Franco - Prussian War .",

                    "context": "In late 1942 , Tresckow and Olbricht formulated a plan to assassinate Hitler and stage an overthrow during Hitler ' s visit to the headquarters of Army Group Centre at Smolensk in March 1943 , by placing a bomb on his plane ( Operation Spark ) . The bomb failed to detonate , and a second attempt a week later with Hitler at an exhibition of captured Soviet weaponry in Berlin also failed . These failures demoralised the conspirators . During 1943 Tresckow tried without success to recruit senior army field commanders such as Field Marshal Erich von Manstein and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt , to support a seizure of power . Tresckow in particular worked on his Commander - in - Chief of Army Group Centre , Field Marshal G\u00fcnther von Kluge , to persuade him to move against Hitler and at times succeeded in gaining his consent , only to find him indecisive at the last minute . However , despite their refusals , none of the Field Marshals reported their treasonous activities to the Gestapo or Hitler . Motivation and goals of the plot While the main goal of the plotters was to remove Hitler from power , they did so for various reasons . The majority of the group behind the 20 July plot were conservative nationalists who shared many goals with Hitler and did not necessarily believe in or understand democratic ideas . Martin Borschat writes that the plot was mainly done by conservative elites who were initially integrated by the Nazi government but during the war lost their influence and were concerned about regaining it . Attitude towards Poland The overall goals towards Poland were mixed within the plotters . Most of the plotters found it desirable to restore the old German borders from 1914 , while others pointed out that the demands are unrealistic and amendments have to be made . Some like Friedrich - Werner Graf von der Schulenburg even saw all of Poland annexed to Germany . To Poland , which was fighting as an ally with both its army and government in exile , the vast territorial demands and traditional nationalistic visions of resistance made the plotters lose all credibility , and Poles saw little difference between them and racist policies of Hitler . Stauffenberg , as one of the leaders of the plot , stated 5 years before the coup in 1939 during the Poland campaign about Poles and Poland : \" It is essential that we begin a systemic colonisation in Poland . But I have no fear that this will not occur . \" Involvement in war crimes and atrocities",

However , Stieff felt unable to kill Hitler . Stauffenberg now decided to do both : to assassinate Hitler , wherever he was , and to manage the plot in Berlin . On 14 July Stauffenberg attended Hitler ' s conferences carrying a bomb in his briefcase , but because the conspirators had decided that Heinrich Himmler and Hermann G\u00f6ring should be killed simultaneously if the planned mobilisation of Operation Valkyrie was to have a chance to succeed , he held back at the last minute because Himmler was not present . In fact , it was unusual for Himmler to attend military conferences . 15 July 1944 : Aborted attempt By 15 July , when Stauffenberg again flew to the Wolfsschanze , this condition had been dropped . The plan was for Stauffenberg to plant the briefcase with the bomb in Hitler ' s conference room with a timer running , excuse himself from the meeting , wait for the explosion , then fly back to Berlin and join the other plotters at the Bendlerblock . Operation Valkyrie would be mobilised , the Reserve Army would take control of Germany and the other Nazi leaders would be arrested . Beck would be appointed provisional head of state , Goerdeler would be chancellor , and Witzleben would be commander - in - chief of the armed forces . Again on 15 July the attempt was called off at the last minute . Himmler and G\u00f6ring were present , but Hitler was called out of the room at the last moment . Stauffenberg was able to intercept the bomb and prevent its discovery . 20 July 1944 Operation Valkyrie initiated On 18 July rumours reached Stauffenberg that the Gestapo had wind of the conspiracy and that he might be arrested at any time \u2013 this was apparently not true , but there was a sense that the net was closing in and that the next opportunity to kill Hitler must be taken because there might not be another . At 10:00 on 20 July Stauffenberg flew back to the Wolfsschanze for another Hitler military conference , once again with a bomb in his briefcase . The conference took place in the main room of Wolf ' s Lair instead of the underground bunker due to the hot weather .",

The Replacement Army ( Ersatzheer ) had an operational plan called Operation Valkyrie , which was to be used in the event that the disruption caused by the Allied bombing of German cities caused a breakdown in law and order , or an uprising by the millions of forced labourers from occupied countries now being used in German factories . Olbricht suggested that this plan could be used to mobilise the Reserve Army for the purpose of the coup . In August and September 1943 , Tresckow drafted the \" revised \" Valkyrie plan and new supplementary orders . A secret declaration began with these words : \" The F\u00fchrer Adolf Hitler is dead ! A treacherous group of party leaders has attempted to exploit the situation by attacking our embattled soldiers from the rear in order to seize power for themselves . \" Detailed instructions were written for occupation of government ministries in Berlin , Heinrich Himmler ' s headquarters in East Prussia , radio stations and telephone offices , and other Nazi apparatus through military districts , and concentration camps . Previously , it was believed that Stauffenberg was mainly responsible for the Valkyrie plan , but documents recovered by the Soviet Union after the war and released in 2007 suggest that the plan was developed by Tresckow by autumn of 1943 . All written information was handled by Tresckow ' s wife , Erika , and by Margarethe von Oven , his secretary . Both women wore gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints . On at least two other occasions Tresckow had tried to assassinate the F\u00fchrer . The first plan was to shoot him during dinner at the army base camp , but this plan was aborted because it was widely believed that Hitler wore a bullet - proof vest . The conspirators also considered poisoning him , but this was not possible because his food was specially prepared and tasted . This left a time bomb as the only option . Operation Valkyrie could only be put into effect by General Friedrich Fromm , commander of the Reserve Army , so he must either be won over to the conspiracy or in some way neutralised if the plan was to succeed . Fromm , like many senior officers , knew in general about the military conspiracies against Hitler but neither supported them nor reported them to the Gestapo . Previous failed attempts During 1943 and early 1944 von Tresckow and von Stauffenberg organised at least four attempts to get one of the military conspirators near enough to Hitler , for long enough to kill him with hand grenades , bombs , or a revolver : * in March 1943 by Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff",

This badge was struck in three values ; Gold , Silver and Black , a total of 100 badges , and 47 are believed to have been awarded , along with an ornate award document for each recipient personally signed by Hitler , making them among the rarest decorations to have been awarded by Nazi Germany . For his role in stopping the coup , Major Remer was promoted to colonel and ended the war as a major general . After the war , he co - founded the Socialist Reich Party and remained a prominent Neo - Nazi and advocate of Holocaust Denial until his death in 1997 . Philipp von Boeselager , the German officer who provided the plastic explosives used in the bomb , escaped detection and survived the war . He was the second - to - last survivor of those involved in the plot and died on 1 May 2008 aged 90 . The last survivor of the 20 July Plot was Ewald - Heinrich von Kleist - Schmenzin , the thwarted plotter of just a few months before . He died on 8 March 2013 , aged 90 . As a result of the failed coup , every member of the Wehrmacht was required to reswear his loyalty oath , by name , to Hitler and , on 24 July 1944 , the military salute was replaced throughout the armed forces with the Hitler Salute in which the arm was outstretched and the salutation Heil Hitler was given . Planned government The conspirators were earlier designated positions in secret to form a government that would take office after the assassination of Hitler were it to prove successful . Because of the plot ' s failure , such a government never rose to power and most of its members were executed . The following were slated for these roles as of July 1944 : * Generaloberst Ludwig Beck ( Army ) \u2013 President * Carl Friedrich Goerdeler ( DNVP ) \u2013 Chancellor * Wilhelm Leuschner ( SPD ) \u2013 Vice - Chancellor * Paul L\u00f6be ( SPD ) \u2013 President of the Reichstag * Julius Leber ( SPD ) or Eugen Bolz ( Centre Party ) \u2013 Minister of the Interior * Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg or Ulrich von Hassell ( DNVP ) \u2013 Foreign Minister * Ewald Loeser ( DNVP ) \u2013 Minister of Finance * Friedrich Olbricht ( Army ) \u2013 Minister of War ( With von Stauffenberg as a possible State Secretary )",

Moltke was against killing Hitler ; instead , he wanted him placed on trial . Moltke said , \" we are all amateurs and would only bungle it \" . Moltke also believed killing Hitler would be hypocritical . Hitler and National Socialism had turned \" wrong - doing \" into a system , something which the resistance should avoid . Plans to stage an overthrow and prevent Hitler from launching a new world war were developed in 1938 and 1939 , but were aborted because of the indecision of Army Generals Franz Halder and Walther von Brauchitsch , and the failure of the Western powers to oppose Hitler ' s aggression until 1939 . This first military resistance group delayed their plans after Hitler ' s extreme popularity following the unexpectedly rapid success in the battle for France . In 1942 , a new conspiratorial group formed , led by Colonel Henning von Tresckow , a member of Field Marshal Fedor von Bock ' s staff , who commanded Army Group Centre in Operation Barbarossa . Tresckow systematically recruited oppositionists to the Group ' s staff , making it the nerve centre of the army resistance . Little could be done against Hitler as he was heavily guarded , and none of the plotters could get near enough to him . During 1942 , Oster and Tresckow nevertheless succeeded in rebuilding an effective resistance network . Their most important recruit was General Friedrich Olbricht , head of the General Army Office headquarters at the Bendlerblock in central Berlin , who controlled an independent system of communications to reserve units throughout Germany . Linking this asset to Tresckow ' s resistance group in Army Group Centre created a viable coup apparatus .",

Gerlach proved that plotters like Tresckow or Gersdorff were aware of mass murder happening in the East from at least 1941 . He writes : \" Especially with reference to the murder of the Jews , [ it is said that ] ' the SS ' had deceived the officers by killing in secret , filing incomplete reports or none at all ; if general staff offices protested , the SS threatened them . \" Gerlach concludes : \" This is , of course , nonsense . \" Tresckow also \" signed orders for the deportation of thousands of orphaned children for forced labor in the Reich \" ( the so - called Heu - Aktion ) . Such actions lead historians to question the motives of the plotters , which seemed to worry more about the military situation than the Nazi atrocities and German war crimes . However some others assert that , in such actions , Tresckow had to act out of principle to continue with his coup plans . Gerlach pointed out that the plotters had \" selective moral criteria \" and while they were concerned about Jews being exterminated in the Holocaust , they were far less disturbed about mass murder of civilians in the East . To Gerlach , the primary motivation of the plotters was to ensure German victory in the war or at least not to lose it . Gerlach ' s arguments were later supported by historian Hans Mommsen , who stated that the plotters were interested above all in military victory . But Gerlach ' s arguments were also criticized by some scholars , among them Peter Hoffmann from McGill University and Klaus Jochen Arnold ( de ) from the Konrad - Adenauer - Stiftung.Peter Hoffmann , Carl Goerdeler and the Jewish question , 1933 - 1942 , Cambridge ; New York : Cambridge University Press , 2011 , xvi.Klaus Jochen Arnold , [ http : / / www.zeitgeschichte - online.de / sites / default / files / media / 20juli _ arnold.pdf Verbrecher aus eigener Initiative ?

He spent most of his time at his headquarters at the Wolfsschanze ( Wolf ' s Lair ) near Rastenburg in East Prussia , with occasional breaks at his Bavarian mountain retreat Obersalzberg near Berchtesgaden . In both places he was heavily guarded and rarely saw people he did not know or trust . Himmler and the Gestapo were increasingly suspicious of plots against Hitler and rightly suspected the officers of the General Staff , which was indeed the source of many conspiracies against Hitler . Preparations By the summer of 1944 , the Gestapo was closing in on the conspirators . There was a sense that time was running out , both on the battlefield , where the Eastern front was in full retreat and where the Allies had landed in France on 6 June , and in Germany , where the resistance ' s room for manoeuvre was rapidly contracting . When Stauffenberg sent Tresckow a message through Lieutenant Heinrich Graf von Lehndorff - Steinort asking whether there was any reason for trying to assassinate Hitler given that no political purpose would be served , Tresckow ' s response was : \" The assassination must be attempted , co\u00fbte que co\u00fbte [ whatever the cost ] . Even if it fails , we must take action in Berlin . For the practical purpose no longer matters ; what matters now is that the German resistance movement must take the plunge before the eyes of the world and of history . Compared to that , nothing else matters . \" Himmler had at least one conversation with a known oppositionist when , in August 1943 , the Prussian Finance Minister Johannes Popitz , who was involved in Goerdeler ' s network , came to see him and offered him the support of the opposition if he would make a move to displace Hitler and secure a negotiated end to the war . Nothing came of this meeting , but Popitz was not immediately arrested ( although he was later executed towards the end of the war ) , and Himmler apparently did nothing to track down the resistance network which he knew was operating within the state bureaucracy . It is possible that Himmler , who by late 1943 knew that the war was unwinnable , allowed the plot to go ahead in the knowledge that if it succeeded he would be Hitler ' s successor , and could then bring about a peace settlement .",

                    "context": "Stagecoach is a 1939 American Western film directed by John Ford , starring Claire Trevor and John Wayne in his breakthrough role . The screenplay , written by Dudley Nichols , is an adaptation of \" The Stage to Lordsburg \" , a 1937 short story by Ernest Haycox . The film follows a group of strangers riding on a stagecoach through dangerous Apache territory . Stagecoach was the first of many Westerns that Ford shot using Monument Valley , in the American south - west on the Arizona \u2013 Utah border , as a location , many of which also starred John Wayne . Scenes from Stagecoach , including a famous sequence introducing John Wayne ' s character the Ringo Kid , blended shots of Monument Valley with shots filmed on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth , California , and other locations . In 1995 , this film was deemed \" culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant \" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry . Plot In 1880 , a motley group of strangers boards the east - bound stagecoach from Tonto , Arizona Territory to Lordsburg , New Mexico Territory . These travelers are unremarkable and ordinary at first glance . Among them are Dallas ( Claire Trevor ) , a prostitute who is being driven out of town by the moralistic \" Law and Order League \" ; an alcoholic doctor , Doc Boone ( Thomas Mitchell ) ; pregnant Lucy Mallory ( Louise Platt ) , who is traveling to meet her cavalry officer husband ; and whiskey salesman Samuel Peacock ( Donald Meek ) . When the stage driver , Buck ( Andy Devine ) , looks for his normal shotgun guard , Marshal Curly Wilcox ( George Bancroft ) tells him that the guard is off searching for the fugitive Ringo Kid . Ringo broke out of prison after hearing that his father and brother had been murdered by Luke Plummer ( Tom Tyler ) . Buck tells Curly that Plummer is in Lordsburg . Knowing that Ringo has vowed to avenge his father and brother , Curly decides to ride along as guard . As the stage sets out , U.S. Cavalry Lieutenant Blanchard ( Tim Holt ) announces that Geronimo and his Apaches are on the warpath ; his small troop will provide an escort to Dry Fork . At the edge of town , two more passengers flag down the stage and board : gambler and Southern gentleman Hatfield ( John Carradine ) , and banker Henry Gatewood ( Berton Churchill ) , who is absconding with $ 50,000 embezzled from his bank .",

                    "context": "Although Ford had made many Westerns in the silent film era , he had never previously directed a sound Western . Between 1929 and 1939 , he directed films in almost every other genre , including Wee Willie Winkie ( 1937 ) , starring Shirley Temple . Ford declined to use Wayne in any of his projects during the 1930s despite their close friendship , telling Wayne to wait until he was \" ready \" as an actor . In 1938 , Ford gave Wayne a copy of the film ' s script by Nichols with a request to recommend an actor to play the Ringo Kid . After reading it , Wayne suggested Lloyd Nolan for the part , but Ford was non - committal to the idea . The next day however , Ford announced to Wayne that he wanted him to play the role . The offer left Wayne feeling as if he had been \" hit in the belly with a baseball bat \" ... and fearing that Ford would change his mind and hire Nolan instead . Before production , John Ford shopped the project around to several Hollywood studios , all of which turned him down because big budget Westerns were out of vogue , and because Ford insisted on using John Wayne in a key role in the film . Wayne previously appeared in only one big - budget western , The Big Trail ( 1930 , directed by Raoul Walsh ) , which was a huge box office flop . Between 1930 \u2013 1939 , by Wayne ' s own estimate , he appeared in about eighty \" Poverty Row \" westerns . Independent producer David O. Selznick finally agreed to produce the film , but was frustrated by Ford ' s indecision about when shooting would begin , and his own doubts over the casting . Ford withdrew the film from Selznick ' s company and approached independent producer Walter Wanger about the project . Wanger had the same reservations about producing an \" A \" western and even more about one starring John Wayne . Ford had not directed a western since the silent days , the most notable of which had been The Iron Horse ( 1924 ) . Wanger said he would not risk his money unless Ford replaced John Wayne with Gary Cooper and brought in Marlene Dietrich to play Dallas .",

Eventually they compromised , with Wanger putting up $ 250,000 , a little more than half of what Ford had been seeking , and Ford would give top billing to Claire Trevor , a more well - known name than John Wayne in 1939 . Following the film ' s release on March 2 , 1939 , Ford ' s faith in John Wayne was rewarded as the film met with immediate critical and trade paper success . Cast member Louise Platt , in a letter recounting the experience of the film ' s production , quoted Ford on saying of Wayne ' s future in film : \" He ' ll be the biggest star ever because he is the perfect ' everyman ' \" . Production The members of the production crew were billeted in Kayenta , in Northeastern Arizona , in an old CCC camp . Conditions were spartan , production hours long , and weather conditions at this 5700 foot elevation were extreme with constant strong winds and low temperatures . Nonetheless , director John Ford was satisfied with the crew ' s location work . For this location , filming took place near Goulding ' s Trading Post on the Utah border , about 25 miles from Kayenta . Reception Stagecoach has been lauded as one of the most influential films ever made .

The rights to \" Lordsburg \" were bought by John Ford soon after it was published in Collier ' s magazine on 10 April 1937 . According to Thomas Schatz , Ford claimed that his inspiration in expanding Stagecoach beyond the bare - bones plot given in \" The Stage to Lordsburg \" was his familiarity with another short story , \" Boule de Suif \" by Guy de Maupassant . Schatz believes \" this scarcely holds up to scrutiny \" and argues that a more likely inspiration was Bret Harte ' s 1892 short story \" The Outcasts of Poker Flat \" . Ford ' s statement also seems to be the basis for the claim that Haycox himself relied upon Guy de Maupassant ' s story . However , there appears to be no concrete evidence for Haycox actually being familiar with the earlier story , especially as he was documented as going out of his way to avoid reading the work of others that might unconsciously influence his writing , and he focused his personal reading in the area of history .",

Many independent companies were responsible for this film in the years since . The film ' s copyright ( originally by Walter Wanger Productions ) was renewed by 20th Century Fox , who produced a later 1966 remake of Stagecoach . The copyright has since been reassigned to Wanger Productions through the late producer ' s family under the Caidin Trust / Caidin Film Company , the ancillary rights holder . However , distribution rights are now held by Shout ! Factory , which in 2014 acquired Jumer Productions / Westchester Films ( which in turn had bought the Caidin Film holdings after the folding of former distributor Castle Hill Productions ) . Warner Bros. Pictures handles sales and additional distribution . The original negatives of Stagecoach were either lost or destroyed . John Wayne had one positive print that had never been through a projector gate . In 1970 , he permitted it to be used to produce a new negative , and that is the film seen today at film festivals . UCLA fully restored the film in 1996 from surviving elements and premiered it on cable ' s American Movie Classics network . The previous DVD releases by Warner Home Video did not contain the restored print , but rather a video print held in the Castle Hill / Caidin Trust library . A digitally restored Blu - ray / DVD version was released in May 2010 via The Criterion Collection . Remakes * The May 4 , 1946 radio episode of Academy Award Theater had Claire Trevor reprise her role alongside Randolph Scott . * The December 7 , 1946 , radio episode of Hollywood Star Time presented Stagecoach , adapted by Milton Geiger . * The January 9 , 1949 radio episode of Screen Directors Playhouse had John Wayne and Claire Trevor both reprise their parts . * The 1966 remake of Stagecoach starred ( in alphabetical order ) Ann - Margret , Red Buttons , Mike Connors , Alex Cord , Bing Crosby , Robert Cummings , Van Heflin , Slim Pickens , and Stefanie Powers . * A 1986 television version featured Willie Nelson , Kris Kristofferson , Johnny Cash , and Waylon Jennings .",

Lonergan , The Classic Rock and Roll Reader : Rock Music from its Beginnings to the mid - 1970s ( Abingdon : Routledge , 1999 ) , ISBN 0 - 7890 - 0151 - 9 It has its roots in 1940s ' and 1950s ' rock and roll , itself heavily influenced by blues , rhythm and blues and country music . Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical sources . Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums . Typically , rock is song - based music usually with a 4 / 4 time signature using a verse - chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis . The dominance of rock by white , male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music . Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship , live performance , and an ideology of authenticity than pop music .",

                    "context": "By the late 1960s , referred to as the \" golden age \" or \" classic rock \" period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , raga rock , and jazz - rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic scene . New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted against the perceived overblown , inauthentic and overly mainstream aspects of these genres to produce a stripped - down , energetic form of music valuing raw expression and often lyrically characterised by social and political critiques . Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres , including new wave , post - punk and eventually the alternative rock movement . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock ' s history , including the garage rock / post - punk and synthpop revivals at the beginning of the new millennium . Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements , leading to major sub - cultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the hippie counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s . Similarly , 1970s punk culture spawned the visually distinctive goth and emo subcultures . Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song , rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race , sex and drug use , and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity . Characteristics The sound of rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar , which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularization of rock and roll , and was influenced by the sounds of electric blues guitarists.Michael Campbell & James Brody , [ https : / / books.google.co.uk / books ? id",

At 15 , Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( YCND ) , having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation . Though he was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school ' s cricket and rugby teams , he disliked his educational experience ; according to Waters , \" I hated every second of it , apart from games . The regime at school was a very oppressive one ... the same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers . \" Whereas Waters knew Barrett and Gilmour from his childhood in Cambridge , he met future Pink Floyd founder members Nick Mason and Richard Wright in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic ( later the University of Westminster ) school of architecture . Waters enrolled there in 1962 , after a series of aptitude tests indicated he was well - suited to that field . He had initially considered a career in mechanical engineering . 1965 \u2013 1985 : Pink Floyd Formation and Barrett - led period By September 1963 , Waters and Mason had lost interest in their studies ; they had moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens , owned by Mike Leonard , a part - time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic . Waters , Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963 , in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe . They usually called themselves Sigma 6 , but also used the name the Meggadeaths . Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums , Wright played on any keyboard he could arrange to use , and Noble ' s sister Sheilagh provided an occasional vocal accompaniment . In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic .",

This trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of other instruments , particularly keyboards such as the piano , Hammond organ and synthesizers . The basic rock instrumentation was adapted from the basic blues band instrumentation ( prominent lead guitar , second chordal instrument , bass , and drums ) . A group of musicians performing rock music is termed a rock band or rock group and typically consists of between three \u2013 the power trio used in rock , metal and punk rock \u2013 and five members . Classically , a rock band takes the form of a quartet whose members cover one or more roles , including vocalist , lead guitarist , rhythm guitarist , bass guitarist , drummer and often that of keyboard player or other instrumentalist . Rock music is traditionally built on a foundation of simple unsyncopated rhythms in a 4 / 4 meter , with a repetitive snare drum back beat on beats two and four.C .

Melodies are often derived from older musical modes , including the Dorian and Mixolydian , as well as major and minor modes . Harmonies range from the common triad to parallel fourths and fifths and dissonant harmonic progressions . Rock songs , since the late 1950s and particularly from the mid - 1960s onwards , often used the verse - chorus structure derived from blues and folk music , but there has been considerable variation from this model . Critics have stressed the eclecticism and stylistic diversity of rock . Because of its complex history and tendency to borrow from other musical and cultural forms , it has been argued that \" it is impossible to bind rock music to a rigidly delineated musical definition . \"",

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades . Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest , although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation . Nevertheless , early songs such as \" Blowin ' in the Wind \" and \" The Times They Are a - Changin ' \" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti - war movements . After he left his initial base in the American folk music revival , his six - minute single \" Like a Rolling Stone \" altered the range of popular music in 1965 . His mid - 1960s recordings , backed by rock musicians , reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement . Dylan ' s lyrics have incorporated various political , social , philosophical , and literary influences . They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture . Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie , Robert Johnson , and Hank Williams , Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres . His recording career , spanning more than 50 years , has explored the traditions in American song \u2013 from folk , blues , and country to gospel , rock and roll , and rockabilly to English , Scottish , and Irish folk music , embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook . Dylan performs with guitar , keyboards , and harmonica . Backed by a changing lineup of musicians , he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour . His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career , but songwriting is considered his greatest contribution .",

In January 1961 , he traveled to New York City , to perform there and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie , who was seriously ill with Huntington ' s disease in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital . Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances . Describing Guthrie ' s impact , he wrote : \" The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them ... [ He ] was the true voice of the American spirit . I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie ' s greatest disciple . \" As well as visiting Guthrie in hospital , Dylan befriended Guthrie ' s acolyte Ramblin ' Jack Elliott . Much of Guthrie ' s repertoire was channeled through Elliott , and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in Chronicles : Volume One . From February 1961 , Dylan played at clubs around Greenwich Village . He befriended and picked up material from folk singers there , including Dave Van Ronk , Fred Neil , Odetta , the New Lost City Ramblers , and Irish musicians the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem . In September , Dylan gained public recognition when Robert Shelton wrote a review in The New York Times of a show at Gerde ' s Folk City . The same month Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hester ' s third album , which brought his talents to the attention of the album ' s producer , John Hammond . Hammond signed Dylan to Columbia Records in October . The performances on his first Columbia album \u2013 Bob Dylan \u2013 in March 1962 , consisted of familiar folk , blues and gospel with two original compositions . The album sold only 5,000 in its first year , just enough to break even.Scaduto , p. 110 . Within Columbia Records , some referred to the singer as \" Hammond ' s Folly \" and suggested dropping his contract , but Hammond defended Dylan and was supported by Johnny Cash . In March 1962 , Dylan contributed harmonica and back - up vocals to the album Three Kings and the Queen , accompanying Victoria Spivey and Big Joe Williams on a recording for Spivey Records . While working for Columbia , Dylan recorded under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt , for Broadside , a folk magazine and record label .

In the September issue of Sing Out ! , Ewan MacColl wrote : \" Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time ... ' But what of Bobby Dylan ? ' scream the outraged teenagers ... Only a completely non - critical audience , nourished on the watery pap of pop music , could have fallen for such tenth - rate drivel . \" On July 29 , four days after Newport , Dylan was back in the studio in New York , recording \" Positively 4th Street \" . The lyrics contained images of vengeance and paranoia , and it has been interpreted as Dylan ' s put - down of former friends from the folk community \u2013 friends he had known in clubs along West 4th Street . Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde In July 1965 , the single \" Like a Rolling Stone \" peaked at two in the U.S. and at four in the UK charts . At over six minutes , the song altered what a pop single could convey . Bruce Springsteen , in his speech for Dylan ' s inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , said that on first hearing the single , \" that snare shot sounded like somebody ' d kicked open the door to your mind \" . In 2004 and in 2011 , Rolling Stone listed it as number one of \" The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time \" . The song opened Dylan ' s next album , Highway 61 Revisited , named after the road that led from Dylan ' s Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans . The songs were in the same vein as the hit single , flavored by Mike Bloomfield ' s blues guitar and Al Kooper ' s organ riffs . \" Desolation Row \" , backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass , offers the sole exception , with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as \" an 11 - minute epic of entropy , which takes the form of a Fellini - esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters , some historical ( Einstein , Nero ) , some biblical ( Noah , Cain and Abel ) , some fictional ( Ophelia , Romeo , Cinderella ) , some literary ( T.S . Eliot and Ezra Pound ) , and some who fit into none of the above categories , notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse . \"",

When Tehran , the only other interested city on the international level , declined to bid due to the concurrent Iranian political and social changes , the IOC awarded Los Angeles the Games by default . This was the second occasion Los Angeles hosted the games , the first being in 1932 . In response to the American - led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow , 14 Eastern Bloc countries , including the Soviet Union , Cuba and East Germany , boycotted the Games ; only Romania elected to attend . For differing reasons , Iran and Libya also boycotted . The USSR announced its intention not to participate on May 8 , 1984 , citing security concerns and \" chauvinistic sentiments and an anti - Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States . \" Boycotting countries organized another large event in June \u2013 September 1984 , called the Friendship Games ; however , not even a single competition was held between July 28 and August 12 . Representatives of the organizing countries , the Soviets in particular , underlined it was \" not held to replace the Olympics \" . Elite athletes from the U.S. and USSR would only compete against each other at the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow , organized in response to the boycotts . Where ambitious construction for the 1976 games in Montreal and 1980 games in Moscow had saddled organizers with expenses greatly in excess of revenues , Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities except a swim stadium and a velodrome that were paid for by corporate sponsors . The Olympic Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California , educate coaches and maintain a sports library . The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered the most financially successful modern Olympics . The host state of California was the home state of U.S. President Ronald Reagan , who officially opened the Games . He had served as Governor of California from 1967 to 1975 . The official mascot of the Los Angeles Games was Sam the Olympic Eagle . The logo of the games featured five blue , white and red stars arranged horizontally and struck through with alternating streaks ; it was named \" Stars in Motion . \" These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch .",

In popular culture In the Season 4 episode , \" Lisa ' s First Word \" , of the U.S. television show The Simpsons , Krusty Burger is featured in a promotion where the characters get free food if they receive a slip that features an event that was \" won \" by the United States . The promotion was rigged , as was said in the episode , where every game card was to be in an event that \" Communists never lose \" . However , almost immediately after that is said , word of the boycott is spread and the rigging backfires . Krusty Burger loses so much money on the promotion that Krusty publicly states that he will \u201c personally spit in every 50th burger \u201d . The Krusty Burger promotion paralleled a real - life McDonald ' s scratch - card promotion from the 1984 Olympics . The promotion was called \u201c If the US Wins , You Win ! \u201d and gave away Big Mac hamburger sandwiches for every gold medal , fries for every silver medal , and Coca - Cola beverages for every bronze . The events of the boycott as well as the earlier 1980 Summer Olympics boycott were referenced in Metal Gear Solid V : The Phantom Pain , when the character Revolver Ocelot explains to Venom Snake what had transpired during the nine years he was in a coma .",

However , no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered , and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles \u2013 Romania \u2013 encountered no problems , and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum .

Games , who expressed his views in a press conference after the boycott was announced , on the same day that the Olympic torch relay in the United States began in New York City . U.S. President Ronald Reagan later stated his belief that the Soviets feared some of their athletes might defect .

This celebration included a speech by the former president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee , Ueberroth , and a re - creation of the lighting of the cauldron . Host selection The selection process for the 1984 Summer Olympics consisted of a single finalized bid , with the International Olympic Committee accepting the bid of Los Angeles . A bid from Tehran was withdrawn before the selection . Los Angeles had unsuccessfully bid for the two previous Summer Olympics , for 1976 and 1980 . The United States Olympic Committee had at least one bid for every Olympics since 1944 , but had not succeeded since the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932 , the previous time a single bid had been issued for the Summer Olympics . Torch relay The 1984 Olympic Torch Relay began in New York City and ended in Los Angeles , traversing 33 states and the District of Columbia . Unlike later torch relays , the torch was continuously carried by runners on foot . The route covered more than 9,320 mi ( 15,000 km ) and involved 3,636 runners , including 200 from the sponsoring company AT & T . Noted athlete O.J . Simpson was among the runners , carrying the torch up the California Incline in Santa Monica . Gina Hemphill , granddaughter of Jesse Owens , carried the torch into the Coliseum , completed a lap around the track , then handed it off to the final runner , Rafer Johnson , winner of the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics . With the torch , he touched off the flame which passed through a specially designed flammable Olympic logo , igniting all five rings . The flame then passed up to cauldron atop the peristyle and remained aflame for the duration of the Games . Music John Williams composed the theme for the Olympiad , \" Olympic Fanfare and Theme \" . This piece won a Grammy for Williams and became one of the most well - known musical themes of the Olympic Games , along with Leo Arnaud ' s \" Bugler ' s Dream \" ; the latter is sometimes attached to the beginning of Olympic Fanfare and Theme . Composer Bill Conti also wrote a song to inspire the weightlifters called \" Power \" . An album , The Official Music of the XXIII Olympiad \u2013 Los Angeles 1984 , featured three of those tracks along with sports themes written for the occasion by popular musical artists including Foreigner , Toto , Loverboy , Herbie Hancock , Quincy Jones , Christopher Cross , Philip Glass and Giorgio Moroder .

It was such a fractured view of the world . Everything and anything could happen . Maybe your wife is n ' t your wife , maybe your kids are n ' t your kids . It really appealed to me . \" Wagner referred to his creation as \" a sort of surreal diary [ \u2026 ] a tone poem \" , set in an \" Orwellian Los Angeles \" . ABC agreed to finance the project on a budget of $ 11 Million , but , remembering the eventual decline of David Lynch ' s Twin Peaks , insisted that the series had \" a complete story , with a beginning , a middle , and an end \" . Actor James Belushi compared the series ( among others ) to the British TV serial The Prisoner , and stated : \" It ' s very tough , very challenging \u2013 a lot of viewers probably wo n ' t dig it . \" Dana Delany suggested that viewers should \" let it wash over you , enjoy each scene , and by the end it ' ll make sense \" . Robert Loggia compared it to Elizabethan play The Duchess of Malfi and the ancient Greek tragedy Medea . ABC , bound to make sure that viewers would n ' t lose attention , had a supplemental book , The Wild Palms Reader , published and offered a telephone hotline with the show ' s initial run . These measures notwithstanding , Stone considered the atmosphere to be more important than the storyline . William Gibson later stated that \" while the mini - series fell drastically short of the serial , it did produce one admirably peculiar literary artifact , The Wild Palms Reader \" ( to which he contributed ) . Both Stone and Gibson called Wagner the creative force behind the series . Production design The United States of the year 2007 as depicted in the series shows a strong influence of Japanese culture , e. g. , in dress and interior and exterior design . Holograms of Miss Alabama and girl group The Supremes even bear Japanese facial features . Other interior details show the influence of Scottish designer and architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh ( 1868 \u2013 1928 ) . Deliberately anachronistic elements include 1960s cars ( like Studebaker police vehicles ) and Edwardian fashion . References in Wild Palms Non - fictitious references",

                    "context": "\" If I Were a Rich Man \" is a popular song from the 1964 musical Fiddler on the Roof . It was written by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock . The song is performed by Tevye , the main character in the musical , and reflects his dreams of glory . The title is inspired by a 1902 monologue by Sholem Aleichem in Yiddish , Ven ikh bin a Rothschild ( If I were a Rothschild ) , a reference to the wealth of the Rothschild family , although the content is quite different . The lyric is based in part on passages from Sholem Aleichem \u2019 s 1899 short story \" The Bubble Bursts . \" Both stories appeared in English in the 1949 collection of stories Tevye ' s Daughters . Analysis The Oxford Companion to the American Musical wrote that the song has \" cantor - like chanting \" , and is \" the most revealing of the many character numbers \" . The Broadway Musical : A Critical and Musical Survey explained that the song contained the most number of Jewish \" commonplaces \" than any other number in the score ; it added the song does twofold : it \" offers such a strong dose of idiom early in the show [ which ] is good for the overall unity \" , and the \" important dramatic function \" of introducing the central character of Tevye through song . History of the Literary Cultures of East - Central Europe argues the song is based on a poem entitled \" If I were Rothchild \" , in reference to a famous and wealthy Jewish entrepreneur . Leading Your Family to Water notes that given a wealthy existence , interestingly Tevye says he would use the time not spent working to \" learn more about his faith \" . The Grammar Devotional likens the phrase \" if I were a rich man \" to the Cowardly Lion ' s \" if I were king of the forest \" in The Wizard of Oz in the context of imagining a scenario . The song is inspired by a Hasidic folk song . Lyrics and style The song is broken into four verses , with a bridge between the third and fourth and a chorus sung at the beginning of the song , and after the second and fourth verses . Musically , it is written in a Jewish klezmer style .",

                    "context": "Through the first two verses , Tevye dreams of the material comforts that wealth would bring him . Sung boisterously and comedically , Tevye first considers the enormous house he would buy and the needless luxuries he would fill it with , including a third staircase \" leading nowhere , just for show , \" then the poultry he would buy to fill his yard . Tevye switches his attention to the luxuries in which he would shower his wife , Golde , in the third verse . He talks of servants to alleviate her workload , fancy clothes for her pleasure , and mountains of food . The song is sung in the same boisterous , comedic style . The music and vocals intensify during the bridge , when Tevye starts lamenting his place in the community as a lowly milkman , and considers the esteem and importance that wealth would bring him . In the final verse , Tevye softens as he further considers his devotion to God . He expresses his sorrow that the long working hours he keeps prevents him from spending as much time in the synagogue as he would like , and how wealth would allow him to spend less time working and more time praying and studying the Torah , and finally asking God if \" it would spoil a vast eternal plan \" if he were wealthy . A repeated phrase throughout the song , \" all day long I ' d bidi - bidi - bum , \" is often misunderstood to refer to Tevye ' s desire not to have to work . However , in an interview with Terry Gross , Sheldon Harnick said he basically made up syllables that he thought would give the effect of Chassidic chanting . The first person to play Tevye , Zero Mostel , then replaced the syllables Harnick had written with ones that Mostel thought would be more authentic . Lyrics are as follows : \" Dear God , you made many , many poor people . I realize , of course , that it ' s no shame to be poor . But it ' s no great honor either ! So , what would have been so terrible if I had a small fortune ? \" If I were a rich man , Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dum . All day long I ' d biddy biddy bum .

However , Joseph was convicted of embezzlement and shortly afterwards , when his income crashed , the family was forced to leave Park Avenue . Of his early days , Capote related , \" I began writing really sort of seriously when I was about eleven .

Years later , he reminisced , \" Not a very grand job , for all it really involved was sorting cartoons and clipping newspapers . Still , I was fortunate to have it , especially since I was determined never to set a studious foot inside a college classroom . I felt that either one was or was n ' t a writer , and no combination of professors could influence the outcome . I still think I was correct , at least in my own case . \" He left his job to live with relatives in Alabama and began writing his first novel , Summer Crossing . Friendship with Harper Lee Capote based the character of Idabel in Other Voices , Other Rooms on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend , Harper Lee . Capote once acknowledged this : \" Mr. and Mrs. Lee , Harper Lee ' s mother and father , lived very near . She was my best friend . Did you ever read her book , To Kill a Mockingbird ? I ' m a character in that book , which takes place in the same small town in Alabama where we lived . Her father was a lawyer , and she and I used to go to trials all the time as children . We went to the trials instead of going to the movies . \" After the Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Lee in 1961 and Capote published In Cold Blood in 1966 , both authors became increasingly distant from each other . Writing career Short story phase Capote began writing short stories from around the age of eight .

The exhibit brings together photos , letters and memorabilia to paint a portrait of Capote ' s early life in Monroeville . Jennings Faulk Carter donated the collection to the Museum in 2005 . The collection comprises 12 handwritten letters ( 1940s \u2013 60s ) from Capote to his favorite aunt , Mary Ida Carter ( Jennings ' mother ) . Many of the items in the collection belonged to his mother and Virginia Hurd Faulk , Carter ' s cousin with whom Capote lived as a child . The exhibit features many references to Sook , but two items in particular are always favorites of visitors : Sook ' s \" Coat of Many Colors \" and Truman ' s baby blanket . Truman ' s first cousin recalls that as children , he and Truman never had trouble finding Sook in the darkened house on South Alabama Avenue because they simply looked for the bright colors of her coat . Truman ' s baby blanket is a \" granny square \" blanket Sook made for him . The blanket became one of Truman ' s most cherished possessions , and friends say he was seldom without it \u2013 even when traveling . In fact , he took the blanket with him when he flew from New York to Los Angeles to be with Joanne Carson on August 23 , 1984 . According to Joanne Carson , when he died at her home on August 25 , his last words were , \" It ' s me , it ' s Buddy , \" followed by , \" I ' m cold . \" Buddy was Sook ' s name for him . Capote on film *In 1961 , Capote ' s novel Breakfast at Tiffany ' s ( 1958 ) , about a flamboyant New York party girl named Holly Golightly , was filmed by director Blake Edwards and starred Audrey Hepburn in what many consider her defining role , though Capote never approved of the many changes to the story , made to appeal to mass audiences . *Capote ' s childhood experiences are captured in the memoir A Christmas Memory ( 1956 ) , which he adapted for television and narrated . Directed by Frank Perry , it aired on December 21 , 1966 , on ABC Stage 67 , and featured Geraldine Page in an Emmy Award - winning performance .",

Gerald Clarke , in Capote : A Biography ( 1988 ) , wrote , \" The famous photograph : Harold Halma ' s picture on the dustjacket of Other Voices , Other Rooms ( 1948 ) caused as much comment and controversy as the prose inside . Truman claimed that the camera had caught him off guard , but in fact he had posed himself and was responsible for both the picture and the publicity . \" Much of the early attention to Capote centered on different interpretations of this photograph , which was viewed as a suggestive pose by some . According to Clarke , the photo created an \" uproar \" and gave Capote \" not only the literary , but also the public personality he had always wanted . \" The photo made a huge impression on the 20 - year - old Andy Warhol , who often talked about the picture and wrote fan letters to Capote . When Warhol moved to New York in 1949 , he made numerous attempts to meet Capote , and Warhol ' s fascination with the author led to Warhol ' s first New York one - man show , Fifteen Drawings Based on the Writings of Truman Capote at the Hugo Gallery ( June 16 \u2013 July 3 , 1952 ) .",

His stories were published in both literary quarterlies and well - known popular magazines , including The Atlantic Monthly , Harper ' s Bazaar , Harper ' s Magazine , Mademoiselle , The New Yorker , Prairie Schooner and Story . In June 1945 , \" Miriam \" was published by Mademoiselle and went on to win a prize , Best First - Published Story , in 1946 .

In addition to \" Miriam \" , this collection also includes \" Shut a Final Door \" , first published in The Atlantic Monthly ( August 1947 ) . After A Tree of Night , Capote published a collection of his travel writings , Local Color ( 1950 ) , which included nine essays originally published in magazines between 1946 and 1950 . \" A Christmas Memory \" , a largely autobiographical story taking place in the 1930s , was published in Mademoiselle magazine in 1956 .

The Los Angeles Times reported that Capote looked \" as if he were dreamily contemplating some outrage against conventional morality \" . The novelist Merle Miller issued a complaint about the picture at a publishing forum , and the photo of \" Truman Remote \" was satirized in the third issue of Mad ( making Capote one of the first four celebrities to be spoofed in Mad ) . The humorist Max Shulman struck an identical pose for the dustjacket photo on his collection , Max Shulman ' s Large Economy Size ( 1948 ) . The Broadway stage revue New Faces ( and the subsequent film version ) featured a skit in which Ronny Graham parodied Capote , deliberately copying his pose in the Halma photo . Random House featured the Halma photo in its \" This is Truman Capote \" ads , and large blowups were displayed in bookstore windows . Walking on Fifth Avenue , Halma overheard two middle - aged women looking at a Capote blowup in the window of a bookstore . When one woman said , \" I ' m telling you : he ' s just young \" , the other woman responded , \" And I ' m telling you , if he is n ' t young , he ' s dangerous ! \" Capote delighted in retelling this anecdote .

                    "context": "The Hunting of the Snark ( An Agony in 8 Fits ) is typically categorized as a nonsense poem written by Lewis Carroll , the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson . Written from 1874 to 1876 , the poem borrows the setting , some creatures , and eight portmanteau words from Carroll ' s earlier poem \" Jabberwocky \" in his children ' s novel Through the Looking Glass ( 1871 ) . Henry Holiday , the illustrator of the poem , thought of it as a \" tragedy \" . The plot follows a crew of ten trying to hunt the Snark , an animal which may turn out to be a highly dangerous Boojum . The only one of the crew to find the Snark quickly vanishes , leading the narrator to explain that it was a Boojum after all . The poem is dedicated to young Gertrude Chataway , whom Carroll met at the English seaside town Sandown in the Isle of Wight in 1875 . Included with many copies of the first edition of the poem was Carroll ' s religious tract , An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves \" Alice \" . The Hunting of the Snark was published by Macmillan in the United Kingdom in late March 1876 , with illustrations by Henry Holiday . It had mixed reviews from reviewers who found it strange . The first printing of The Hunting of the Snark consisted of 10,000 copies . There were two reprintings by the conclusion of the year ; in total , the poem was reprinted 17 times between 1876 and 1908 . Carroll often denied knowing the meaning behind the poem ; however , in an 1896 reply to one letter , he agreed with one interpretation of the poem as an allegory for the search for happiness . Scholars have found various meanings in the poem , among them existential angst , an allegory for tuberculosis , and a mockery of the Tichborne case . The Hunting of the Snark has been alluded to in various works and has been adapted for musicals , opera , plays , and music . Plot Setting",

At the time Carroll approached him to ask if he could create three illustrations for the poem , Carroll had three ' fits ' , as he called the parts of his poem \u2013 fit can mean either canto or convulsion \u2013 completed : \" The Landing \" , \" The Hunting \" , and \" The Vanishing \" . He intended to title it The Boojum and include it in his fantasy novel Sylvie and Bruno , which was unfinished at the time . However , in late October 1875 , Carroll thought about having it published during Christmas ; this proved impossible , as the wood engraving for the illustrations needed three months to be complete . By the time Holiday had completed the sketches and sent them to Carroll , Carroll had already created a new fit requiring an illustration . They worked this way until Holiday had created nine illustrations as well as the front cover and the back cover of the book . The completed poem comprised 141 stanzas of four lines each , with internal rhymes in the first and third lines of irregular stanzas appearing in the poem from the second fit onwards . Holiday and Carroll additionally had some disagreements on the artwork . Carroll initially objected to Holiday ' s personification of hope and care , but agreed to the change , when Holiday explained that he had only intended to add another layer of meaning to the word \" with \" . However , Carroll refused his illustration of the Boojum , preferring that the creature go without a depiction , and made him change his initial portrayal of the Broker , as it could be perceived as anti - semitic .

In a letter to the mother of his young friend Gertrude Chataway , Carroll described the domain of the Snark as \" an island frequented by the Jubjub and the Bandersnatch \u2013 no doubt the very island where the Jabberwock was slain . \" Characters The crew consists of ten members , whose descriptions all begin with the letter B : a Bellman , the leader ; a \" Boots \" , who is the only member of the crew without an illustration ; a maker of Bonnets and Hoods ; a Barrister , who settles arguments among the crew ; a Broker , who can appraise the goods of the crew ; a Billiard - marker , who is greatly skilled ; a Banker , who possesses all of the crew ' s money ; a Butcher , who can only kill beavers ; a Beaver , who makes lace and has saved the crew from disaster several times ; and a Baker , who can only bake wedding cake , forgets his belongings and his name , but possesses courage .

The Bellman warns them that some Snarks are highly dangerous Boojums , causing the Baker to faint .

The Barrister , meanwhile , dreams of the court trial of a pig accused of deserting its sty , whom the Snark is defending . The Snark , however , finds the pig guilty and sentences it to transportation and a fine of forty pound . His dream concludes with the jailer informing the court that the pig has actually been dead for years , to the judge ' s disgust . During the hunt , the Banker finds himself attacked by a bandersnatch , and loses his sanity after trying to bribe the creature . At the conclusion of the poem , the Baker calls out that he has found a snark , but when the others arrive , he has mysteriously disappeared , leading the narrator to explain : \" For the Snark was a Boojum , you see . \" Development Two explanations of which event in Carroll ' s life gave rise to The Hunting of the Snark have been offered . Biographer Morton N. Cohen connects the creation of The Hunting of the Snark with the illness of Carroll ' s cousin and godson , the twenty - two - year - old Charlie Wilcox . On 17 July 1874 , Carroll travelled to Guildford , Surrey , to care for him for six weeks , while the young man struggled with tuberculosis . The next day , while taking a walk in the morning after only a few hours of sleep , Carroll thought of the poem ' s final line : \" For the Snark was a Boojum , you see . \" Fuller Torrey and Judy Miller suggest that the event that inspired the poem was the sudden death of Carroll ' s beloved uncle , Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge , caused by a violent mentally - ill patient in 1873 , during Lutwidge ' s time as an inspector of lunatic asylums . They support their analysis with parts of the poem , such as the Baker ' s uncle ' s advice to seek the Snark with thimbles , forks , and soap , which , according to Torrey and Miller , were all items the lunatic asylum inspectors checked during their visits .",

However , based on a draft by Lewis Carroll , the Snark was allowed to show up in an illustration by Henry Holiday , where it appeared in a dream of the Barrister . As for the word \" Snark \" , Carroll did not give it any meaning . The word \" snarking \" had been used in 1866 to describe a sound . First publishing Upon the printing of the book on 29 March 1876 , Carroll gave away eighty signed copies to his favourite young friends ; in a typical fashion , he signed them with short poems , many of them acrostics of the child ' s name . He dedicated The Hunting of the Snark to Chataway , whom he had befriended in summer 1875 at the English seaside town Sandown on the Isle of Wight . He finished the dedication a month after befriending her , a double acrostic poem that not only spelled out her name , but contained a syllable of her name in the first line of each stanza . The stanza of his first draft concluded \" Rest on a friendly knee , the tale to ask / That he delights to tell . \" The poem was printed in The Hunting of the Snark with permission from Chataway ' s mother . Included with many copies of the first edition of The Hunting of the Snark was Carroll ' s three - page , religious tract to his young readers , An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves \" Alice \" . Largely written on 5 February 1876 , An Easter Greeting explores the concept of innocence and eternal life through biblical allusions and literary allusions to Romantic writers William Blake and William Wordsworth . Gardner suggests that Carroll included the tract as a way of balancing the dark tone of the poem . Scholar Selwyn Goodacre speculates that , as many copies of first - edition of the poem contain the tract , there is a possibility that all first editions originally had a copy of An Easter Greeting . Reception and legacy The first printing of The Hunting of the Snark consisted of 10,000 copies . By the conclusion of 1876 , it had seen two reprints , with a total of 18,000 or 19,000 copies circulating . In total , the poem was reprinted seventeen times between 1876 and 1908 .",

The Academys Andrew Lang criticised Carroll ' s decision to use poetry instead of prose and its too appealing title . The Athenaeum described it as \" the most bewildering of modern poetry , \" wondering \" if he has merely been inspired to reduce to idiotcy as many readers and more especially reviewers , as possible . \" According to Vanity Fair , Carroll ' s work had progressively worsened after Alice ' s Adventures in Wonderland ( 1865 ) , with The Hunting of the Snark being the worst of his works and \" not worthy [ of ] the name of nonsense \" . While The Spectator wrote that the poem ' s final line had the potential to become a proverb , it criticised the poem as \" a failure \" that might have succeeded with more work from the author . The Saturday Review wrote that the poem offered \" endless speculation \" as to the true identity of the snark , although the unnamed reviewer felt that the familiar nature of Carroll ' s nonsense weakened its effect for the reader . Conversely , The Graphic praised the poem as a welcome departure from the Alice books , and called it \" a glorious piece of nonsense , \" that could appeal to all Alice fans . \" The Hunting of the Snark \" has in common some elements with Carroll ' s other works . It shares its author ' s love of puns on the word ' fit ' with Alice ' s Adventures in Wonderland , and mentions of \" candle - ends \" and \" toasted cheese \" with his supernatural poem Phantasmagoria . Additionally all three works include the number \" 42 \" . Another of Carroll ' s children ' s novels , Sylvie and Bruno Concluded ( 1893 ) makes a reference to the Boojum .

American author Edith Wharton ( 1862 - 1937 ) was fond of the poem as a child . Additionally , it has also been alluded to in fiction , such as Perelandra ( 1943 ) by C.S . Lewis ; television , such as \" The Soul of Genius \" episode of the British TV crime drama Lewis ; court rulings , such as in Parhat v. Gates ( 2008 ) ; a phenomenon in superfluidity ; graph theory ; geography , as a Snark Island and Boojum Rock exist in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal ; Japanese animation , such as Ghost Hound ( 2007 \u2013 08 ) ; and in video games , such as Half - Life ( 1998 ) and American McGee ' s Alice ( 2000 ) . Analysis Various themes have been suggested by scholars . According to biographer Florence Becker Lennon , the poem ' s \" motif of loss of name or identity \" is typical of Carroll ' s work . Richard Kelly writes that the poem contains a \" theme of annihilation . \" Furthermore , Edward Guiliano feels that the Snark is within the nonsense tradition of Thomas Hood and , especially , W. S. Gilbert , the librettist of the famous Gilbert and Sullivan team . According to him , a case can be made for a direct influence of Gilbert ' s Bab Ballads on The Hunting of the Snark , based on the fact that Carroll was well - acquainted with the comic writing and the theatre of his age .",

However , in an 1896 reply to one letter , he agreed with one interpretation of the poem as an allegory for the search for happiness . Widely varying interpretations of The Hunting of the Snark have been suggested : an allegory for tuberculosis , a mockery of the Tichborne case , a satire of the controversies between religion and science , the repression of Carroll ' s sexuality , and a piece against vivisection , among others . According to Cohen , the poem represents a \" voyage of life \" , with the Baker ' s disappearance caused by his violation of the laws of nature by hoping to unravel its mysteries . Lennon sees The Hunting of the Snark as \" a tragedy of frustration and bafflement , \" comparable to British actor Charlie Chaplin ' s early comedies . According to Kelly , The Hunting of the Snark is \" Carroll ' s comic rendition of his fears of disorder and chaos , with the comedy serving as a psychological defense against the devastating idea of personal annihilation . \" Kelly writes that the Bellman ' s Rule of Three and starting each character ' s name with the letter B are \" notable attempts to create a sense of order and meaning out of chaos . \" Martin Gardner sees the poem as dealing with existential angst , and states that the Baker may be Carroll ' s satire of himself , pointing to the fact that the Baker was named after a beloved uncle , as was Carroll , and that the two were around the same age at the time of the writing of the poem . Alternatively , Larry Shaw of the fan magazine Inside and Science Fiction Advertiser suggests that the Boots , being the Snark , actually murdered the Baker .",

At the 1996 Grammy Awards , the song won Coolio a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance .

The album Gangsta ' s Paradise was released in 1995 and was certified 2X Platinum by the RIAA .

Background and writing The artists co - wrote the song its producer Doug Rasheed , with Stevie Wonder receiving writing credits for the sampling of his song \" Pastime Paradise \" from his album Songs in the Key of Life . The Stevie Wonder sample is the reason why this is one of few Coolio tracks without profanity , as Wonder would not allow it . Coolio said , \" I had a few vulgarities ... and he was n ' t with that . So I changed it . Once he heard it , he thought it was incredible . \" The song begins with a line from Psalm 23:4 : \" As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death \" , but then diverges with : \" I take a look at my life and realize there ' s nothin ' left . \" Adding to some of the religious overtones are choral vocals in the background .

However , the narrative turns at this point with Coolio threatening rival gangs with certain death in the event that they take verbal liberties or transgress into his territory . He subsequently educates the listener on the history behind his current position in society ; explaining the way in which his upbringing has entrapped him by creating his lust for power , money and murder . However it is at this point that he acknowledges the uncertainty of his survival on the street . Coolio therefore begins to lament the cyclical nature of the violence in which he partakes , as well as elucidating the collective chaos created by individual greed , selfishness and a lack of education or role models . He ends his personal journey on a hopeless admission : that his situation and surroundings will never improve . Music video The music video for the song was directed by Antoine Fuqua , and featured Michelle Pfeiffer reprising her earlier role in Dangerous Minds .

Prior to this he was the 40th Vice President of the United States , serving from 1973 until President Richard Nixon ' s resignation in 1974 . He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment , following the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew on October 10 , 1973 . Becoming president upon Richard Nixon ' s departure on August 9 , 1974 , he claimed the distinction as the first and to date the only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to either office . As he was appointed to fill a vacancy and then succeeded to the presidency , Ford also earned the distinction of being the only person in American history to neither begin nor finish either a presidential or vice presidential term on the date of a regularly - scheduled inauguration . Before ascending to the vice presidency , Ford served 25 years as Representative from Michigan ' s 5th congressional district , the final 9 of them as the House Minority Leader . As President , Ford signed the Helsinki Accords , marking a move toward d\u00e9tente in the Cold War . With the conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency , U.S. involvement in Vietnam essentially ended . Domestically , Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression , with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure . One of his more controversial acts was to grant a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal . During Ford ' s presidency , foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play , and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President . In the GOP presidential primary campaign of 1976 , Ford defeated then - former California Governor Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination . He narrowly lost the presidential election to the Democratic challenger , then - former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter , on November 2 .",

Regardless , historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the election in 1976 , an observation with which Ford agreed . In an editorial at the time , The New York Times stated that the Nixon pardon was a \" profoundly unwise , divisive and unjust act \" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president ' s \" credibility as a man of judgment , candor and competence \" . On October 17 , 1974 , Ford testified before Congress on the pardon . He was the first sitting President since Abraham Lincoln to testify before the House of Representatives . In the months following the pardon , Ford often declined to mention President Nixon by name , referring to him in public as \" my predecessor \" or \" the former president . \" When , on a 1974 trip to California , White House correspondent Fred Barnes pressed Ford on the matter , Ford replied in surprisingly frank manner : \" I just can \u2019 t bring myself to do it . \u201d",

Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years , holding the Grand Rapids congressional district seat from 1949 to 1973 . It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty . As an editorial in The New York Times described him , Ford \" saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler , and the record shows it : he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career . \" Appointed to the House Appropriations Committee two years after being elected , he was a prominent member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee . Ford described his philosophy as \" a moderate in domestic affairs , an internationalist in foreign affairs , and a conservative in fiscal policy . \" Ford was known to his colleagues in the House as a \" Congressman ' s Congressman \" .

Following the election , members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader . Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve ; after consulting with his family , he agreed . After a closely contested election , Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as Minority Leader . In January 1965 , the Republicans had 140 seats in the House compared with the 295 seats held by the Democrats . With that large majority , and a majority in the U.S. Senate , the Johnson Administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by Johnson the \" Great Society . \" During the first session of the Eighty - ninth Congress alone , the Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress , and Johnson signed 84 , or 96 % , arguably the most successful legislative agenda in Congressional history . In 1966 , criticism over the Johnson Administration ' s handling of the Vietnam War began to grow , with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war . Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson , and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47 - seat swing in favor of the Republicans . This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House , but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs . Ford ' s private criticism of the Vietnam War became public following a speech from the floor of the House , in which he questioned whether the White House had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion . The speech angered President Johnson , who accused Ford of playing \" too much football without a helmet \" . As Minority Leader in the House , Ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen , in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson ' s policies . Many in the press jokingly called this \" The Ev and Jerry Show . \" Johnson said at the time , \" Jerry Ford is so dumb he ca n ' t fart and chew gum at the same time . \" The press , used to sanitizing LBJ ' s salty language , reported this as \" Gerald Ford ca n ' t walk and chew gum at the same time . \"",

Occasionally they would reunite , as in 1975 for their Top Ten single \" My Little Town \" , which Simon originally wrote for Garfunkel , claiming Garfunkel ' s solo output was lacking \" bite . \" The song was included on their respective solo albums : Paul Simon ' s Still Crazy After All These Years and Garfunkel ' s Breakaway . Contrary to popular belief , the song is not autobiographical of Simon ' s early life in New York City but of Garfunkel ' s childhood in Queens . In 1981 , they got together again for the famous concert in Central Park , followed by a world tour and an aborted reunion album Think Too Much , which was eventually released ( without Garfunkel ) as Hearts and Bones . Together , they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 . In 2003 , the two reunited again when they received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award . This reunion led to a US tour : the acclaimed \" Old Friends \" concert series . It was followed by a 2004 international encore , which culminated in a free concert at the Colosseum in Rome . The final concert drew 600,000 people . 1970 \u2013 1975 : Hiatus and first album During a three - year hiatus after Simon & Garfunkel ' s break - up , Garfunkel starred in two Mike Nichols films , Catch - 22 ( 1970 ) and Carnal Knowledge ( 1971 ) . He also spent late 1971 to early 1972 working as a mathematics teacher teaching high school sophomores geometry at a short lived Litchfield Private School Litchfield Academy in Connecticut ( by request of his fianc\u00e9e Linda Marie Grossman ) . In late 1972 , with Simon & Garfunkel having released their Greatest Hits album and briefly reuniting to perform a benefit concert for presidential candidate George McGovern , Garfunkel felt ready to return to his musical career . His first album was 1973 ' s Angel Clare , which contained \" All I Know \" along with \" I Shall Sing \" and \" Travelling Boy \" as singles . The album was received with mixed reviews , reaching no . 5 in the U.S . In 1974 , Garfunkel released the hit record \" Second Avenue \" .",

Robinson ! \" Simon & Garfunkel returned to England in the fall of 1968 and made a concert appearance at Kraft Hall which was broadcast on the BBC and also featured Garfunkel ' s solo performance of \" For Emily , Whenever I May Find Her \" , which received a standing ovation . While Garfunkel was not a songwriter per se , he did write the poem \" Canticle \" as a re - write of Simon ' s \" Side of A Hill \" from his debut album , for \" Scarborough Fair / Canticle \" . He also worked as the vocal arranger for the duo , working out who the songs would be sung by and how each song was produced .

It was constructed in 1876 and demolished in 1987 after the death of its last prisoner , Rudolf Hess , to prevent it from becoming a neo - Nazi shrine . The site was later rebuilt as a shopping centre for the British forces stationed in Germany . History Spandau Prison was built in 1876 on Wilhelmstra\u00dfe . It initially served as a military detention center . From 1919 it was also used for civilian inmates . It held up to 600 inmates at that time . In the aftermath of the Reichstag fire of 1933 , opponents of Hitler and journalists such as Egon Kisch and Carl von Ossietzky were held there in so - called protective custody . Spandau Prison became a sort of predecessor of the Nazi concentration camps . While it was formally operated by the Prussian Ministry of Justice , the Gestapo tortured and abused its inmates , as Egon Erwin Kisch recalls in his memories of Spandau Prison . By the end of 1933 the first Nazi concentration camps had been erected ( at Dachau , Osthofen , Oranienburg , Sonnenburg , Lichtenburg and the marshland camps around Esterwegen ) ; all remaining prisoners who had been held in so - called protective custody in state prisons were transferred to these concentration camps . After World War II it was operated by the Four - Power Authorities to house the Nazi war criminals sentenced to imprisonment at the Nuremberg Trials . Only seven prisoners were finally imprisoned there . Arriving from Nuremberg on 18 July 1947 , they were : Of the seven , three were released after serving their full sentences , while three others ( including Raeder and Funk , who were given life sentences ) were released earlier due to ill health . Between 1966 and 1987 , Rudolf Hess was the only inmate in the prison and his only companion was the warden , Eugene K. Bird , who became a close friend . Bird wrote a book about Hess ' s imprisonment titled The Loneliest Man in the World . Spandau was one of only two Four - Power organizations to continue to operate after the breakdown of the Allied Control Council ; the other was the Berlin Air Safety Center . The four occupying powers of Berlin alternated control of the prison on a monthly basis , each having the responsibility for a total of three months out of the year . Observing the Four - Power flags that flew at the Allied Control Authority building could determine who controlled the prison .",

Besides the sixty or so soldiers on duty in or around the prison at any given time , there were teams of professional civilian warders from each of the four countries , four prison directors and their deputies , four army medical officers , cooks , translators , waiters , porters and others . This was perceived as a drastic misallocation of resources and became a serious point of contention among the prison directors , politicians from their respective countries , and especially , the West Berlin government , who were left to foot the Spandau bill yet suffered a lack of space in their own prison system . The debate surrounding the imprisonment of the seven war criminals in such a large space , with such a numerous and expensive complementary staff , was only heightened as time went on and prisoners were released . Acrimony reached its peak after the release of Speer and Schirach in 1966 , leaving only one inmate , Hess , remaining in an otherwise under - utilized prison . Various proposals were made to remedy this situation , ranging from moving the prisoners to an appropriately sized wing of another larger , occupied prison , to releasing them ; house arrest was also considered . Nevertheless , an official \" refraining [ o ] rder \" went into effect , forbidding the approaching of unsettled prisoners ; and so , the prison remained exclusively for the seven war criminals for the remainder of its existence . Life in the prison Prison regulations Every facet of life in the prison was strictly set out by an intricate prison regulation scheme designed before the prisoners ' arrival by the Four Powers \u2013 France , Britain , the Soviet Union and the United States . Compared with other established prison regulations at the time , Spandau ' s rules were quite strict . The prisoners ' outgoing letters to families were at first limited to one page every month , talking with fellow prisoners was prohibited , newspapers were banned , diaries and memoirs were forbidden , visits by families were limited to one of fifteen minutes every two months , and lights were flashed into the prisoners ' cells every fifteen minutes during the night as a form of suicide watch . A considerable portion of the stricter regulations was either later revised toward the more lenient , or deliberately ignored by prison staff .",

To further ensure its erasure , the site was made into a parking facility and a NAAFI shopping center , named The Britannia Centre Spandau and nicknamed Hessco ' s after the well known British supermarket chain , Tesco . All materials from the demolished prison were ground to powder and dispersed in the North Sea or buried at the former RAF Gatow airbase . In 2013 a single brick turned up on the BBC programme Antiques Roadshow . As of 2006 , a Kaiser ' s Supermarket , ALDI , and a Media Markt consumer electronics store occupied the former prison grounds . In late 2008 , Media Markt left the main shopping complex . The space lies now abandoned . In 2011 the new owner , a development company applied for permission to demolish the cinema complex of the Britannia Centre , which is used by ALDI . The contracts for both , the cinema complex and the shopping complex , with Kaiser ' s , were terminated . The prison The prison , initially designed for a population in the hundreds , was an old brick building enclosed by one wall 4.5 m ( 15 ft. ) high , another of 9 m ( 30 ft. ) , a 3 m ( 10 ft. ) high wall topped with electrified wire , followed by a wall of barbed wire . In addition , some of the sixty soldiers on guard duty manned 6 machine - gun armed guard \u2019 s towers 24 hours a day . Due to the number of cells available , an empty cell was left between the prisoners ' cells , to avoid the possibility of prisoners ' communicating in Morse code . Other remaining cells in the wing were designated for other purposes , with one being used for the prison library and another for a chapel . The cells were approximately 3 metres ( 10 ft. ) long by 2.7 metres ( 9 ft. ) wide and 4 metres ( 13 ft. ) high . Garden",

Speer and Funk , acutely aware of the likely psychosomatic nature of the illness , were more accommodating to Hess . Speer , in a move that invoked the ire of his fellow prisoners , would often tend to Hess ' needs , bringing him his coat when he was cold and coming to his defence when a director or guard was attempting to coax Hess out of bed and into work . Hess occasionally wailed in pain at night , affecting the sleep of the other prisoners . The prison ' s medical officer would inject Hess with what was described as a \" sedative \" but was in reality distilled water and succeeded in putting Hess to sleep . The fact that Hess repeatedly shirked duties the others had to bear and received other preferential treatment because of his illness , irked the other prisoners and earned him the title of \" His imprisoned Lordship \" by the admirals . Hess was also unique among the prisoners in that , as a matter of dignity , he refused all visitors for more than twenty years , finally consenting to see his long - since adult son and wife in 1969 after suffering from a perforated ulcer that required his treatment at a hospital outside the prison . Fearing for his mental health , now that he was the sole remaining inmate , and that his death was imminent , the prison directors agreed to slacken most of the remaining regulations , moving Hess to the more spacious former chapel space , giving him a water heater to allow the making of tea or coffee when he liked , and permanently unlocking his cell so that he could freely access the prison ' s bathing facilities and library . Hess was frequently moved from room to room every night for security reasons . He was often taken to BMH ( British Military Hospital ) not far from Spandau prison where the entire second floor of the hospital was blocked off for him . He continued to be under heavy guard while in hospital . Ward security was provided by soldiers including Royal Military Police ( RMP ) Close Protection personnel . External security was provided by one of the British infantry battalions then stationed in Berlin . On some unusual occasions , the Russians relaxed their strict regulations ; during these times Hess was allowed to spend extra time in the prison garden , and one of the warders from the superpowers took Hess outside the prison for a stroll and sometimes dinner .

The two former Grand Admirals , Erich Raeder and Karl D\u00f6nitz , stayed together , despite their heated mutual dislike . This situation had come about when D\u00f6nitz replaced Raeder as Commander in Chief of the German navy in 1943 . Baldur von Schirach and Walther Funk were described as \" inseparable \" . Konstantin von Neurath was , being a former diplomat , amiable and amenable to all the others . Despite the length of time they spent with each other , remarkably little progress was made in the way of reconciliation . A notable example was D\u00f6nitz ' s dislike of Speer being steadfastly maintained for his entire ten - year sentence , with it only coming to a head during the last few days of his imprisonment . D\u00f6nitz always believed that Hitler had named him as his successor due to Speer ' s recommendation , which had led to D\u00f6nitz being tried at Nuremberg ( Speer always denied this ) . There is a collection of medical reports on Baldur von Schirach , Albert Speer , and Rudolf Hess during their confinement at Spandau . Albert Speer The prisoners were assigned numbers corresponding to the order in which they were first assigned cells and were , by regulation , referred to by their number only . Speer , number five , was the most ambitious of the prisoners , dedicating himself to a rigorous physical and mental work regime , then scheduling \" vacations \" of two weeks in length every few months where he relieved himself from his self - imposed routine . He secretly wrote two books , a draft of his memoirs entitled Inside the Third Reich and a collection of diary entries , Spandau : The Secret Diaries . Speer also kept busy with architectural works , designing a Californian summer home for a guard . He would frequently go on \" walking tours of the world \" by ordering geography and travel books from the local library and walking laps in the prison garden visualizing his journey . Meticulously calculated , he \" travelled \" more than 24,000 km before his release . Erich Raeder and Karl D\u00f6nitz",

The Soviet Union , which suffered 19 million civilian deaths during the war and had pressed at the Nuremberg trials for the execution of all the current inmates , was unwilling to compromise with the Western powers in this regard , both because of the harsher punishment that they felt was justified , and to stress the Communist propaganda line that the capitalist powers had supposedly never been serious about denazification . This contrasted with Werl Prison , which housed hundreds of former officers and other lower - ranking Nazi men who were under a comparatively lax regime . Western commentators accused the Russians of keeping Spandau prison in operation chiefly as a centre for Soviet espionage operations . Daily life Every day , prisoners were ordered to rise at 06:00 hours , wash , clean their cells and the corridor together , eat breakfast , stay in the garden until lunch - time at noon ( weather permitting ) , have a post - lunch rest in their cells , then return to the garden . Supper followed at 17:00 hours , after which the prisoners were returned to their cells . Lights out was at 22:00 hours .

By regulation , all of the produce was to be put toward use in the prison kitchen , but prisoners and guards alike often skirted this rule and indulged in the garden ' s offerings . As prison regulations slackened and as prisoners became either apathetic or too ill to maintain their plots , the garden was consolidated into one large workable area . This suited the former architect Speer , who , being one of the youngest and liveliest of the inmates , later took up the task of refashioning the entire plot of land into a large complex garden , complete with paths , rock gardens and floral displays .

Like Ballard ' s earlier short story \" The Dead Time \" ( published in the anthology Myths of the Near Future ) , it is essentially fiction but draws extensively on Ballard ' s experiences in World War II . The name of the novel is derived from the etymology of the name for Japan . Ballard later wrote of his experiences in China as a boy and the making of the film of the same name in his autobiography Miracles of Life . Plot The novel recounts the story of a young British boy , Jamie Graham ( named after Ballard ' s two first names , \" James Graham \" ) , who lives with his parents in Shanghai . After the Pearl Harbor attack , Japan occupies the Shanghai International Settlement , and in the following chaos Jim becomes separated from his parents . He spends some time in abandoned mansions , living on remnants of packaged food . Having exhausted the food supplies , he decides to try to surrender to the Japanese Army . After many attempts , he finally succeeds and is interned in the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center . Although the Japanese are \" officially \" the enemies , Jim identifies partly with them , both because he adores the pilots with their splendid machines and because he feels that Lunghua is still a comparatively safer place for him . Towards the end of the war , with the Japanese army collapsing , the food supply runs short . Jim barely survives , with people around him starving to death . The camp prisoners are forced upon a march to Nantao , with many dying along the route . Jim then leaves the march and is saved from starvation by air drops from American Bombers . Jim returns to Lunghua camp and finds Dr. Ransome there , soon returning to his pre - war residence with his parents . Film adaptation The book was adapted by Tom Stoppard in 1987 . The screenplay was filmed by Steven Spielberg , to critical acclaim , being nominated for six Oscars and winning three British Academy Awards ( for cinematography , music and sound ) . It starred a then 13 - year - old Christian Bale , as well as John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson ; it also featured a cameo by a 21 - year - old Ben Stiller , in a dramatic role .",

It was also played within the introduction video of the new Yahoo ! logo on 5 September 2013 , played over the end credits of the 2013 film Paranoia , and featured in the movie Dumb and Dumber To . \" Alive \" was also a featured song on the soundtrack of EA Sports game , FIFA 14 . In December 2014 , Empire of the Sun released two songs , \" Tonight \" and \" Wandering Star \" , which were written for the Farrelly brothers film , Dumb and Dumber To . On 21 March 2015 , the band performed at the 2015 Cumbre Taj\u00edn in Veracruz , Mexico . On 30 December 2015 , Empire of the Sun announced the release of a new album in 2016 on their Facebook page . In January 2016 , the band ' s 2008 album title track \" Walking on a Dream \" was featured in a national commercial titled \" The Dreamer \" in the United States for the Japanese automaker Honda to promote the 2016 Honda Civic . The song finally led to U.S. chart breakthrough for the band , peaking at Number 3 on Billboard ' s Alternative music charts , topping the dance music charts , and peaking at # 40 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart . Name Although the name of the project has been attributed to the 1984 novel of the same name by J. G. Ballard , Littlemore denied this and offers an explanation , saying , \" the name comes more from the idea of ( and you ' ll see this in the ongoing videos ) the fact that we ' re traveling around the world going to all the places of empires of the civilization where the sun has been a theme of worship . It ' s not based on the Ballard novel nor the Spielberg film of the same name \" . Style The band employs elaborate stage sets and headdress , which reflects the duo ' s background in visual art . Littlemore explained that \" we did see Alejandro Jodorowsky ' s Holy Mountain and it influenced the way we could think about visualization \" . However , he emphasised that the inspiration came from various sources . Awards and accolades In the UK , they gained fourth position on the BBC News website ' s Sound of 2009 poll . Empire of the Sun appeared for the first time in a Triple J Hottest 100 with two entries in the 2008 countdown : \" We Are the People \" at number sixty - eight and \" Walking on a Dream \" at number four .",

An airport consists of a landing area , which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off or a helipad , and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers , hangars and terminals . Larger airports may have fixed - base operator services , airport aprons , taxiway bridges , air traffic control centres , passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges , and emergency services . An airport with a helipad for rotorcraft but no runway is called a heliport . An airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base . Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings , and seaplane docks for tying - up . An international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control . In warfare , airports can become the focus of intense fighting , for example the Battle of Tripoli Airport or the Battle for Donetsk Airport , both taking place in 2014 . An airport primarily for military use is called an airbase or air station . Most of the world ' s airports are owned by local , regional , or national government bodies . Landside and airside areas Airports are divided into landside and airside . Landside includes parking lots , public transport railway stations and access roads . Airside includes all areas accessible to aircraft , including runways , taxiways and ramps . Passage between landside and airside is tightly controlled at all airports . To access airside , one must go through Passport Control and Security , this applies to everyone , including staff . Most major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services .

Airport ownership and operation Most of the world ' s airports are owned by local , regional , or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport ' s operation . For example , in the United Kingdom the state - owned British Airports Authority originally operated eight of the nation ' s major commercial airports - it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s , and following its takeover by the Spanish Ferrovial consortium in 2006 , has been further divested and downsized to operating just five . Germany ' s Frankfurt Airport is managed by the quasi - private firm Fraport . While in India GMR Group operates , through joint ventures , Indira Gandhi International Airport and Rajiv Gandhi International Airport . Bengaluru International Airport and Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport are controlled by GVK Group . The rest of India ' s airports are managed by the Airports Authority of India . In the United States commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government - created airport authorities ( also known as port authorities ) , such as the Los Angeles World Airports authority that oversees several airports in the Greater Los Angeles area , including Los Angeles International Airport . In Canada , the federal authority , Transport Canada , divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999 / 2000 . Now most airports in Canada are owned and operated by individual legal authorities or are municipally owned . Many U.S. airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms , who operate functions such as retail management and parking . In the U.S. , all commercial airport runways are certified by the FAA under the Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 Part 139 , \" Certification of Commercial Service Airports \" but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the FAA . Despite the reluctance to privatize airports in the US ( despite the FAA sponsoring a privatization program since 1996 ) , the government - owned , contractor - operated ( GOCO ) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world .

All airports use a traffic pattern to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft . There are a number of aids available to pilots , though not all airports are equipped with them . Many airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain , snow , or fog . In the U.S. and Canada , the vast majority of airports , large and small , will either have some form of automated airport weather station , a human observer or a combination of the two . Air safety is an important concern in the operation of an airport , and airports often have their own safety services . Terminology The terms aerodrome , airfield , and airstrip may also be used to refer to airports , and the terms heliport , seaplane base , and STOLport refer to airports dedicated exclusively to helicopters , seaplanes , or short take - off and landing aircraft . In colloquial use , the terms airport and aerodrome are often interchanged . However , in general , the term airport may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that an aerodrome may not have achieved . In some jurisdictions , airport is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant national aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements . That is to say , all airports are aerodromes , but not all aerodromes are airports . In jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between aerodrome and airport , which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision . Aerodrome is uncommon in the United States . Infrastructure Smaller or less - developed airports , which represent the vast majority , often have a single runway shorter than . Larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways or longer . Many small airports have dirt , grass , or gravel runways , rather than asphalt or concrete . In the United States , the minimum dimensions for dry , hard landing fields are defined by the FAR Landing And Takeoff Field Lengths . These include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff . Heavier aircraft require longer runways . The longest public - use runway in the world is at Qamdo Bangda Airport in China . It has a length of 5500 m. The world ' s widest paved runway is at Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport in Russia and is 105 m wide .",

Airside areas include all areas accessible to aircraft , including runways , taxiways and aprons . Access from landside areas to airside areas is tightly controlled at most airports . Passengers on commercial flights access airside areas through terminals , where they can purchase tickets , clear security check , or claim luggage and board aircraft through gates . The waiting areas which provide passenger access to aircraft are typically called concourses , although this term is often used interchangeably with terminal . The area where aircraft park next to a terminal to load passengers and baggage is known as a ramp ( or incorrectly , \" the tarmac \" ) . Parking areas for aircraft away from terminals are called aprons . Airports can be towered or non - towered , depending on air traffic density and available funds . Due to their high capacity and busy airspace , many international airports have air traffic control located on site . Airports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities . However , as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations , such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport . International flights often require a higher level of physical security , although in recent years , many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel . Some airport structures include on - site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building . Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal . Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers . \" Floating airports \" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as pneumatic stabilized platform technology . Products and services Most major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services . Most of these companies , many of which are internationally known brands , are located within the departure areas . These include clothing boutiques and restaurants . Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport . However , some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \" street prices \" . This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers ' suggested retail price ( MSRP ) but are almost never discounted . Apart from major fast food chains , some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food or culture without leaving the airport .",

In addition cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas \u2013 export , import and interline or transhipment Support services Aircraft and Passenger Boarding Bridges Maintenance , Pilot Operations , Commissioning , Training Services , aircraft rental , and hangar rental are most often performed by a fixed - base operator ( FBO ) . At major airports , particularly those used as hubs , airlines may operate their own support facilities . Some airports , typically military airbases , have long runways used as emergency landing sites . Many airbases have arresting equipment for fast aircraft , known as arresting gear \u2013 a strong cable suspended just above the runway and attached to a hydraulic reduction gear mechanism . Together with the landing aircraft ' s arresting hook , it is used in situations where the aircraft ' s brakes would be insufficient by themselves . In the United States , many larger civilian airports also host an Air National Guard base . Airport access Many large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of multimodal transport , for instance Frankfurt Airport , Amsterdam Airport Schiphol , London Heathrow Airport , London Gatwick Airport and London Stansted Airport . It is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit , light rail lines or other non - road public transport systems . Some examples of this would include the AirTrain JFK at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York , Link Light Rail that runs from the heart of downtown Seattle to Seattle \u2013 Tacoma International Airport , and the Silver Line T at Boston ' s Logan International Airport by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ( MBTA ) . Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion . Large airports usually have access also through controlled - access highways ( ' freeways ' or ' motorways ' ) from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop . Internal transport The distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial . It is common for airports to provide moving walkways and buses . The Hartsfield \u2013 Jackson Atlanta International Airport has a tram that takes people through the concourses and baggage claim . Major airports with more than one terminal offer inter - terminal transportation , such as Mexico City International Airport , where the domestic building of Terminal 1 is connected by Aerotr\u00e9n to Terminal 2 , on the other side of the airport .

A slight improvement was the dirt - only field , which eliminated the drag from grass . However , these only functioned well in dry conditions . Later , concrete surfaces would allow landings , rain or shine , day or night . The title of \" world ' s oldest airport \" is disputed , but College Park Airport in Maryland , US , established in 1909 by Wilbur Wright , is generally agreed to be the world ' s oldest continually operating airfield , although it serves only general aviation traffic .

Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation , it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating . Rome Ciampino Airport , opened 1916 , is also a contender , as well as the Don Mueang International Airport near Bangkok , Thailand , which opened in 1914 . Increased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields .

They went from a legitimate title contender to a team that hovered around .500 in winning percentage . The Pistons eventually became the Central Division champions . Despite the difficulties with the suspensions and injuries , the Pacers earned a sixth seed in the playoffs with a record of 44 \u2013 38 . An important reason for their strong finish was the re - acquisition of Dale Davis , who had been released by the New Orleans Hornets after being traded there by the Golden State Warriors . He played the final 25 games of the regular season and every playoff game , contributing a strong presence at center . And Davis ' signing coincided with an injury to Jermaine O ' Neal that would knock him out for virtually the remainder of the regular season \u2013 indeed , O ' Neal ' s first missed game due to his injury was Davis ' first game back with the Pacers . Despite the adversity they had gone through , the Pacers made the playoffs for the 13th time in 14 years . In the first round , Indiana defeated the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics in seven games , winning Game 7 in Boston by the decisive margin of 97 \u2013 70 , just the third time the Celtics had dropped a Game 7 at home . The Pacers then advanced to the second - round against the Detroit Pistons , in a rematch of the previous year ' s Eastern Conference Finals . The series featured games back at The Palace of Auburn Hills , the scene of the brawl that many assumed at the time had effectively ended the Pacers ' season . After losing Game 1 , the Pacers won the next two games to take a 2 \u2013 1 lead . However , the Pacers could not repeat their victories against the Pistons and lost the next 3 games , losing the series 4 \u2013 2 . The final game ( Game 6 ) was on May 19 , 2005 ; Reggie Miller , in his final NBA game , scored 27 points and received a huge standing ovation from the crowd . Despite Miller ' s effort , the Pacers lost , sending Miller into retirement without an NBA Championship in his 18 - year career , all with the Pacers . Miller had his No . 31 jersey retired by the Pacers on March 30 , 2006 when the Pacers played the Phoenix Suns . 2005 \u2013 2010 : Post - Reggie Miller & Danny Granger era",

In game 3 Jermaine O ' Neal scored 37 points , as the Pacers regained a 2 \u2013 1 series lead . The Nets , however , won games four and five to take a 3 \u2013 2 series lead . In Game 6 Anthony Johnson scored 40 points but the Pacers ' season came to an end as the Nets won 96 \u2013 90 . The Pacers finished the 2006 \u2013 07 season as one of the worst seasons in team history . For the Pacers , who finished with a 35 \u2013 47 record , nearly everything that could have gone wrong did . The turning point of the season would be an 11 - game losing streak that started around the all - star break . Injuries to Jermaine O ' Neal and Marquis Daniels , a lack of a solid back up point guard , the blockbuster trade midway through the season that interrupted the team chemistry , poor defensive efforts , and being the NBA ' s worst offensive team were the main reasons leading to the team ' s struggles . The April 15 loss to New Jersey Nets knocked the Pacers out of the playoffs for the first time since the 1996 \u2013 97 season .",

In particular , there are accusations that the team may have intentionally lost the 1955 NBA Finals to the Syracuse Nationals . In the decisive Game 7 , the Pistons led Syracuse 41 \u2013 24 early in the second quarter , then the Nationals rallied to win the game . Syracuse won on a free throw by George King with twelve seconds left in the game . The closing moments included a palming turnover by the Pistons ' George Yardley with 18 seconds left , a foul by Frankie Brian with 12 seconds left that enabled King ' s winning free throw , and a turnover by the Pistons ' Andy Phillip with three seconds left which cost Fort Wayne a chance to attempt the game - winning shot . 1957 \u2013 1979 : Decades of struggle Though the Pistons enjoyed a solid local following , Fort Wayne ' s small size made it difficult for them to be profitable , especially as other early NBA teams based in smaller cities started folding or relocating to larger markets . After the 1956 \u2013 57 season , Zollner decided that Fort Wayne was too small to support an NBA team and announced the team would be playing elsewhere in the coming season . He ultimately settled on Detroit . Although it was the fifth largest city in the United States at the time , Detroit had not seen professional basketball in a decade . In 1947 , they had lost the Detroit Gems of the NBL ( whose remnants became the Minneapolis Lakers ) , and the Detroit Falcons of the BAA . Zollner decided to keep the Pistons name , believing it made sense given Detroit ' s status as the center of the automobile industry . The new Detroit Pistons played in Olympia Stadium ( home of the NHL ' s Detroit Red Wings at the time ) for their first four seasons , then moved to Cobo Arena . The franchise was a consistent disappointment , struggling both on the court and at the box office . During the 1960s and 1970s , the Pistons were characterized by very strong individuals and weak teams . In fact , in their first 27 years in Detroit , they only had three winning seasons . Some of the superstars who played for the team included Dave DeBusschere , Dave Bing , Jimmy Walker , and Bob Lanier .",

Many fans at the time disagreed with Miller ' s selection over Indiana Hoosiers ' standout Steve Alford . The Pacers missed the playoffs in 1987 \u2013 88 , drafted Rik Smits in the 1988 NBA draft , and suffered through a disastrous 1988 \u2013 89 season in which coach Jack Ramsay stepped down following an 0 \u2013 7 start . Mel Daniels and George Irvine filled in on an interim basis before Dick Versace took over the 6 \u2013 23 team on the way to a 28 \u2013 54 finish . In February 1989 , the team traded veteran center Herb Williams to the Dallas Mavericks for future NBA Sixth Man - of - the Year Detlef Schrempf . From 1989 to 1993 , the Pacers would play at or near .500 and qualify for the playoffs , in 1989 \u2013 90 , the Pacers parlayed a fast start into the team ' s third playoff appearance . But the Pacers were swept by the Detroit Pistons , who would go on to win their second consecutive NBA Championship . Reggie Miller became the first Pacer to play in the All - Star Game since 1976 on the strength of his 24.6 points - per - game average . Despite four straight first round exits , this period was highlighted by a first round series with the Boston Celtics in 1991 that went to Game 5 . The next season , the Pacers returned to the playoffs in 1992 and met the Celtics for the second year in a row . But this time , the Celtics left no doubt who was the better team , as they swept the Pacers in three straight games . Chuck Person and point guard Micheal Williams were traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the offseason , and the Pacers got Pooh Richardson and Sam Mitchell in return . For the 1992 \u2013 93 season , Detlef Schrempf moved from sixth man to the starter at small forward and was elected to his first All - Star game . Miller , meanwhile , became the Pacers ' all - time NBA era leading scorer during this season ( 4th overall ) .

He was dealt to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Scot Pollard , who spent much of the following year watching from the bench and backing up Jeff Foster . The Pacers also signed Larry Bird as team president , and Bird wasted little time in dismissing coach Isiah Thomas and replacing him with Rick Carlisle . The Pacers responded to Carlisle extremely well , and had a breakthrough 2003 \u2013 04 season in which they finished 61 \u2013 21 , earning the best record in the NBA as well as a franchise record . O ' Neal and Artest made the All - Star team , and Artest was named the NBA ' s Defensive Player of the Year , the Pacers swept the Boston Celtics easily in the first round , and squeezed by a scrappy Miami Heat team in the conference semifinals .

DeShannon recorded it in 1974 ; Carnes ' s 1981 version spent nine weeks at No . 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was Billboards biggest hit of the entire year for 1981 . It was also her only Top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart , getting to No . 10 . The 1981 recording won the 1982 Grammy Awards for both Record of the Year and Song of the Year . History The song was written and composed in 1974 by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon . DeShannon recorded the song that same year on her album New Arrangement . In this original incarnation , the track is performed in an \" R & B lite \" arrangement , featuring a prominent uptempo piano part , as well as flourishes of pedal steel guitar and horns . However , it was not until 1981 , when Kim Carnes recorded her version of the song in a radically different synthesizer - based arrangement , that \" Bette Davis Eyes \" became a commercial success . The Carnes version spent nine non - consecutive weeks on top of the US Billboard Hot 100 ( interrupted for one week by the \" Stars on 45 Medley \" ) and was Billboard ' s biggest hit of the year for 1981 . The single also reached No . 5 on Billboard ' s Top Tracks charts and No . 26 on the Dance charts . The song won the Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Record of the Year . The song was also a number one hit in 21 countries and peaked at number 10 in the United Kingdom , her only Top 40 hit there to date . According to producer Val Garay , the original demo of the tune that was brought to him sounded like \" a Leon Russell track , with this beer - barrel polka piano part . \" The demo can be heard in a Val Garay interview on TAXI TV at 21:50 . Keyboardist Bill Cuomo came up with the signature synth riff , using the Sequential Circuits Prophet - 5 synthesizer , which now defines Carnes ' s version . The song was recorded in the studio on the first take . Bette Davis wrote letters to Carnes , Weiss , and DeShannon to thank all three of them for making her \" a part of modern times , \" and said her grandson now looked up to her . After their Grammy wins , Davis sent them roses as well .",

In the first chorus , she performs with a band ; halfway dancers enter the hall . In the second verse , the dancers make slapping and floor - pounding dance motions . They disappear and reappear in the second chorus .

                    "context": "Traffic was finding the 2.84 m ( 9 ft 4 in ) wide lanes narrow , and the sidewalks were inadequate for pedestrians and cyclists . As a result , the main bridge deck was replaced in 2000 and 2001 \u2013 the first time a suspension bridge ' s deck had been replaced . As with the earlier work , this was facilitated by a series of separate nighttime and weekend closures to replace one section at a time . The old section would be lowered to a barge , and the new one raised into place and connected . The change allowed the two pedestrian walkways to be moved to the outside of the structure and the road lanes were accordingly widened from 3 to 3.6 m ( from 10 to 12 ft ) each ; the new sidewalks are also wider , 2.7 m ( 9 ft ) each instead of 1.2 m ( 4 ft ) . Also , the main structural elements were moved to below the bridge deck , thus giving a much more open appearance . The entire suspended structure was thus replaced with little or no interruption in daytime traffic . Landmark *The Lions Gate Bridge has become a landmark of Vancouver and the North Shore . *The bridge was featured on the first title card of CBC supper - hour newscast Canada Now , but it was replaced with a local image in several markets . *The bridge is often used in television broadcasts as a symbol of Vancouver ; most telecasts of NHL hockey games played in Vancouver show the bridge at least once . *The bridge is the namesake of locally founded film company Lionsgate . *The bridge was featured in a short sequence of the film Drawing Flies . *The bridge was featured in the closing sequence of the film Tron : Legacy , released December 17 , 2010 . *The bridge was featured as the set of 2011 film Final Destination 5 released August 12 , 2011 . *The bridge was featured in the closing credits of Da Vinci ' s Inquest .

                    "context": "The Lions Gate Bridge , opened in 1938 , officially known as the First Narrows Bridge , is a suspension bridge that crosses the first narrows of Burrard Inlet and connects the City of Vancouver , British Columbia , to the North Shore municipalities of the District of North Vancouver , the City of North Vancouver , and West Vancouver . The term \" Lions Gate \" refers to The Lions , a pair of mountain peaks north of Vancouver . Northbound traffic on the bridge heads in their general direction . A pair of cast concrete lions , designed by sculptor Charles Marega , were placed on either side of the south approach to the bridge in January , 1939 . The total length of the bridge including the north viaduct is 1,823 metres ( 5,890 feet ) . The length including approach spans is 1,517.3 m ( 4,978 ft ) , the main span alone is 473 m ( 1,550 ft ) , the tower height is 111 m ( 364 ft ) , and it has a ship ' s clearance of 61 m ( 200 ft ) . Prospect Point in Stanley Park offered a good high south end to the bridge , but the low flat delta land to the north required construction of the extensive North Viaduct . The bridge has three reversible lanes , the use of which is indicated by signals . The centre lane changes direction to accommodate for traffic patterns . The traffic volume on the bridge is 60,000 - 70,000 vehicles per day . Trucks exceeding 13 tonnes ( 14.3 tons ) are prohibited , as are vehicles using studded tires . The bridge forms part of Highways 99 and 1A . On March 24 , 2005 , the Lions Gate Bridge was designated a National Historic Site of Canada . History Starting about 1890 , bridge builders saw that a bridge across the first narrows was becoming a possibility . There were a number who argued against its construction , as many felt it would ruin Stanley Park or cause problems for the busy seaport or that it would take toll revenue away from the Second Narrows Bridge . However , many others saw it as necessary in order to open up development on the North Shore and it was felt that these problems could be overcome . The decision was put to the electorate of Vancouver in 1927 , but the first plebiscite was defeated and the idea was put to rest for a short while .",

                    "context": "Another difference with the original configuration was that in an effort to recover the expenditure it cost to build the bridge , the Guinness family had toll booths installed . The toll booths remained on the bridge until 1963 , at which time the bridge was purchased by the provincial government for the same price that it took to build it . Changes were made shortly after the takeover , as the tolls were removed and the overhead lane controls were added . The Guinnesses \u2019 last involvement with the bridge happened in 1986 , when they added lights to the bridge as an Expo ' 86 gift . In 1975 , the deteriorating north viaduct was replaced with a lighter , wider , and stronger steel deck with wider lanes . This was carried out in sections using a series of short closures of the bridge ; each time , one old section was lowered from the bridge and its replacement was put into place . In 1986 the Guinness family , as a gift to Vancouver , purchased decorative lights that make it a distinctive nighttime landmark . In July 2009 , the bridge ' s lighting system was updated with new LED lights to replace this existing system of 100 - watt mercury vapour bulbs . The switch to LEDs is expected to reduce power consumption on the bridge by 90 per cent and save the Province about $ 30,000 a year in energy and maintenance costs . The approximate cost of this project was $ 150,000 , paid for by the ministry and B.C . Hydro . \" The average replacement time of one of the traditional light bulbs was about 72 hours , \" said the ministry ' s Jeff Knight . With the new LED bulbs , which are designed to last 12 years , it could be a decade before any work crew is called out to do a replacement . By the 1990s , it was time for the bridge to be either significantly upgraded or replaced . A number of different proposals were considered , including building a new bridge beside the existing bridge , building a tunnel from Downtown Vancouver to the north shore , or double decking the existing bridge . However , none of the proposals could overcome the City of Vancouver ' s objections to any increase in traffic into the downtown core and the province ' s unwillingness to spend much money on the project . In the end , it was decided to upgrade the existing bridge without adding any new lanes .",

However , he was able to convince the Guinness family ( of the Irish stout fame ) to invest in the land on the north shore of Burrard Inlet . They purchased 4,700 acres ( 16 km\u00b2 ) of West Vancouver mountainside through a syndicate called British Pacific Properties Ltd . On December 13 , 1933 , a second plebiscite was held and this time , it was passed by a 2 to 1 margin . After considerable further negotiations with the federal government , approval was finally granted , with the requirement that Vancouver materials and workmen be used as much as possible to provide employment during the Great Depression . The 1933 bylaw authorizing construction included a provision mandating that \u201c no Asiatic person shall be employed in or upon any part of the undertaking or other works . \u201d The bridge was designed by the Montreal firm Monsarrat and Pratley , which was later responsible for the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge in Halifax , Nova Scotia using a similar design . Other companies involved in the construction of the bridge include : Swan Wooster Engineering , Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas , Rowan Williams Davies & Irwin Inc. , Canron Western Constructors , Dominion Bridge Company , American Bridge Company . Construction began on March 31 , 1937 . After one and a half years and a cost of $ 5,873,837.17 ( CAD ) , it opened to traffic on November 14 , 1938 . On May 29 , 1939 , King George VI and Queen Elizabeth presided over the official opening during a royal visit to Canada . A toll of 25 cents was charged for each car . On January 20 , 1955 , the Guinness family sold the bridge to the province for $ 5,959,060 , and in 1963 , the tolls were dropped . The newly constructed bridge differed from the current configuration of the bridge as it originally had only two lanes . Yet , as had been foreseen , West Vancouver \u2019 s population boomed as a result of the new connection . Thus , to accommodate the increased population , the lanes were divided into three with the middle lane acting as a passing lane . Eventually overhead lane control signals were installed , enabling traffic in the centre lane to be directed in either direction , and facilitating emergency vehicle access by closing off the center lane .",

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering , making it the world ' s second - largest country by total area and the fourth - largest country by land area . Canada ' s border with the United States is the world ' s longest land border . Canada is sparsely populated , the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains ; about four - fifths of the country ' s population of 35 million people live near the southern border . The majority of Canada has a cold or severely cold winter climate , but southerly areas are warm in summer . Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples . Beginning in the 15th and 16th centuries , British and French claims were made on the area , with the colony of Canada first being established by the French in 1537 . As a consequence of various conflicts , the United Kingdom gained and lost territories within British North America until it was left , in the late 18th century , with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today . Pursuant to the British North America Act , on July 1 , 1867 , the colonies of Canada , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia joined to form the semi - autonomous federal Dominion of Canada . This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the mostly self - governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada . In 1931 , Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931 , and full sovereignty was attained when the Canada Act 1982 removed the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy , with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state . The country is officially bilingual at the federal level . It is one of the world ' s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations , the product of large - scale immigration from many other countries . Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world , relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well - developed international trade networks . Canada ' s long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture .",

It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency , civil liberties , quality of life , economic freedom , and education .

Etymology While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada , the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata , meaning \" village \" or \" settlement \" . In 1535 , indigenous inhabitants of the present - day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona . Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village , but the entire area subject to Donnacona ( the chief at Stadacona ) ; by 1545 , European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the St Lawrence River as Canada . From the 16th to the early 18th century \" Canada \" referred to the part of New France that lay along the St. Lawrence River . In 1791 , the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named The Canadas ; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841 . Upon Confederation in 1867 , Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country , and the word Dominion was conferred as the country ' s title . The transition away from the use of Dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the Canada Act , which refers only to Canada . Later that year , the national holiday was renamed from Dominion Day to Canada Day . The term Dominion is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces , though after the Second World War the term federal had replaced dominion . History Aboriginal peoples",

The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago , though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival . The Paleo - Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada . The characteristics of Canadian Aboriginal societies included permanent settlements , agriculture , complex societal hierarchies , and trading networks . Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations . The aboriginal population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million , with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada ' s Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples . As a consequence of contact with European diseases , Canada ' s aboriginal peoples suffered from repeated outbreaks of newly introduced infectious diseases , such as influenza , measles , and smallpox ( to which they had no natural immunity ) , resulting in a forty to eighty percent population decrease in the centuries after the European arrival . Although not without conflict , European Canadians ' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful . The Crown and Aboriginal peoples began interactions during the European colonialization period , though , the Inuit , in general , had more limited interaction with European settlers . From the late 18th century , European Canadians encouraged Aboriginals to assimilate into their own culture . These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations . A period of redress is underway , which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Canadian government . European colonization",

No further European exploration occurred until 1497 , when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada ' s Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England . Then Basque and Portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast in the early 16th century . In 1534 , French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Saint Lawrence River , where , on July 24 , he planted a 10 m cross bearing the words \" Long Live the King of France \" and took possession of the territory ( known as the colony of Canada ) in the name of King Francis I . In general the settlements appear to have been short - lived , possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in Scandinavia and northern Canada and the problems of navigating trade routes at that time . In 1583 , Sir Humphrey Gilbert , by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I , founded St. John ' s , Newfoundland , as the first North American English colony . French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal ( in 1605 ) and Quebec City ( in 1608 ) . Among the colonists of New France , Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present - day Maritimes , while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes , Hudson Bay , and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana . The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid - 17th - century over control of the North American fur trade . The English established additional colonies in Cupids and Ferryland , Newfoundland , beginning in 1610 . The Thirteen Colonies to the south were founded soon after . A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763 ; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years ' War . Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and the 1763 Treaty of Paris ceded Canada and most of New France to Britain after the Seven Years ' War .",

Filming had to be placed on a five - month hiatus after Matthau suffered a serious heart attack . He gave up his three pack a day smoking habit as a result . Matthau appeared during the Oscar telecast shortly after having been injured in a bicycle accident ; nonetheless , he scolded actors who had not attended the ceremony , especially the other major award winners that night : Paul Scofield , Elizabeth Taylor and Sandy Dennis . Oscar nominations would come Matthau ' s way again for Kotch ( 1971 ) , directed by Lemmon , and The Sunshine Boys ( 1975 ) , another adaptation of a Neil Simon stage play , this time about a pair of former vaudeville stars . For the latter role he won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy . Broadway hits turned into films continued to cast Matthau in lead roles in Hello , Dolly ! and Cactus Flower ( both 1969 ) ; for the latter film , Goldie Hawn received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress . Matthau played three roles in the film version of Simon ' s Plaza Suite ( 1971 ) and was in the cast of its followup California Suite ( 1978 ) . Matthau starred in three crime dramas in the mid - 1970s , as a detective investigating a mass murder on a bus in The Laughing Policeman ( 1973 ) , as a bank robber on the run from the Mafia and the law in Charley Varrick ( also 1973 ) and as a New York transit cop in the action - adventure The Taking of Pelham One Two Three ( 1974 ) .

In 1801 , Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland . Toponymy The name \" England \" is derived from the Old English name Englaland , which means \" land of the Angles \" . The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain during the Early Middle Ages . The Angles came from the Angeln peninsula in the Bay of Kiel area of the Baltic Sea . The earliest recorded use of the term , as \" Engla londe \" , is in the late ninth century translation into Old English of Bede ' s Ecclesiastical History of the English People . The term was then used in a different sense to the modern one , meaning \" the land inhabited by the English \" , and it included English people in what is now south - east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of Northumbria . The Anglo - Saxon Chronicle recorded that the Domesday Book of 1086 covered the whole of England , meaning the English kingdom , but a few years later the Chronicle stated that King Malcolm III went \" out of Scotlande into Lothian in Englaland \" , thus using it in the more ancient sense . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , its modern spelling was first used in 1538 .",

                    "context": "The earliest attested reference to the Angles occurs in the 1st - century work by Tacitus , Germania , in which the Latin word Anglii is used . The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars ; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula , an angular shape . How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others , such as the Saxons , came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known , but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain Angli Saxones or English Saxons . In Scottish Gaelic , another language which developed on the island of Great Britain , the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England ( Sasunn ) ; similarly , the Welsh name for the English language is \" Saesneg \" . An alternative name for England is Albion . The name Albion originally referred to the entire island of Great Britain . The nominally earliest record of the name appears in the Aristotelian Corpus , specifically the 4th century BC De Mundo : \" Beyond the Pillars of Hercules is the ocean that flows round the earth . In it are two very large islands called Britannia ; these are Albion and Ierne \" . But modern scholarly consensus ascribes De Mundo not to Aristotle but to Pseudo - Aristotle , i.e . it was written later in the Graeco - Roman period or afterwards . The word Albion ( \u1f08\u03bb\u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ) or insula Albionum has two possible origins . It either derives from a cognate of the Latin albus meaning white , a reference to the white cliffs of Dover , the only part of Britain visible from the European Continent , or from the phrase the \" island of the Albiones \" in the now lost Massaliote Periplus , that is attested through Avienus ' Ora Maritima to which the former presumably served as a source . Albion is now applied to England in a more poetic capacity . Another romantic name for England is Loegria , related to the Welsh word for England , Lloegr , and made popular by its use in Arthurian legend . History Prehistory and antiquity The earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of Homo antecessor , dating to approximately 780,000 years ago . The oldest proto - human bones discovered in England date from 500,000 years ago . Modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the Upper Paleolithic period , though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years .",

                    "context": "During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories , but by the 7th century , when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available , these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria , Mercia , Wessex , East Anglia , Essex , Kent and Sussex . Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued . The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia , which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence . In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex . Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England , overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria , Mercia and East Anglia . Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom , and under his successors it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw . This brought about the political unification of England , first accomplished under \u00c6thelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953 . A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016 , turning it into the centre of a short - lived North Sea Empire that also included Denmark and Norway . However the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042 . A dispute over the succession to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066 , accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy . The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries . This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French - speaking aristocracy , whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language .",

They reigned for three centuries , some noted monarchs being Richard I , Edward I , Edward III and Henry V. The period saw changes in trade and legislation , including the signing of the Magna Carta , an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign ' s powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen . Catholic monasticism flourished , providing philosophers , and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage . The Principality of Wales became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century and the Lordship of Ireland was given to the English monarchy by the Pope . During the 14th century , the Plantagenets and the House of Valois both claimed to be legitimate claimants to the House of Capet and with it France ; the two powers clashed in the Hundred Years ' War . The Black Death epidemic hit England ; starting in 1348 , it eventually killed up to half of England ' s inhabitants . From 1453 to 1487 civil war occurred between two branches of the royal family \u2013 the Yorkists and Lancastrians \u2013 known as the Wars of the Roses . Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the Tudors , a branch of the Lancastrians headed by Henry Tudor who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries , gaining victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field where the Yorkist king Richard III was killed . Early Modern During the Tudor period , the Renaissance reached England through Italian courtiers , who reintroduced artistic , educational and scholarly debate from classical antiquity . England began to develop naval skills , and exploration to the West intensified . Henry VIII broke from communion with the Catholic Church , over issues relating to his divorce , under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England . In contrast with much of European Protestantism , the roots of the split were more political than theological . He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535 \u2013 1542 acts . There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry ' s daughters , Mary I and Elizabeth I . The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again , forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism .",

The name literally means \" round - eyed \" or \" circle - eyed \" . Hesiod described three one - eyed Cyclopes , Brontes , Steropes and Arges , the sons of Uranus and Gaia , brothers of the Titans , builders and craftsmen , while the epic poet Homer described another group of mortal herdsmen Cyclopes the sons of Poseidon . Other accounts were written by the playwright Euripides , poet Theocritus and Roman epic poet Virgil . In Hesiod ' s Theogony , Zeus releases three Cyclopes from the dark pit of Tartarus . They provide Zeus ' thunderbolt , Hades ' helmet of invisibility , and Poseidon ' s trident , and the gods use these weapons to defeat the Titans . In a famous episode of Homer ' s Odyssey , the hero Odysseus encounters the Cyclops Polyphemus , the son of Poseidon and Thoosa , who lives with his fellow Cyclopes in a distant country . The connection between the two groups has been debated in antiquity and by modern scholars . It is upon Homer ' s account that Euripides and Virgil based their accounts of the mythical creatures . Strabo describes another group of seven Lycian Cyclopes , also known as \" Bellyhands \" because they earned from their handicraft . They had built the walls of Tiryns and perhaps the caverns and the labyrinths near Nauplia , which are called cyclopean . Mythology and literature All the other sources of literature about the cyclopes describe the cyclops Polyphemus , who lived upon an island ( often identified by ancient authors with Sicily ) populated by the creatures . Various ancient Greek and Roman authors wrote about Cyclopes . Hesiod described them as three brothers who were primordial giants . Homer While Homer does not specifically state that the Cyclopes are one - eyed , this is implied when Odysseus blinds Polyphemus by plunging a stake into his one eye . Hesiod",

It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece . Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization , and to gain understanding of the nature of myth - making itself . Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives , and implicitly in Greek representational arts , such as vase - paintings and votive gifts . Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world , and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods , goddesses , heroes , heroines and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral - poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature . The oldest known Greek literary sources , Homer ' s epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath . Two poems by Homer ' s near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias . Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology , with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes . Sources",

Gaia is the great mother of all : the primal Greek Mother Goddess ; creator and giver of birth to the Earth and all the Universe ; the heavenly gods , the Titans , and the Giants were born to her . The gods reigning over their classical pantheon were born from her union with Uranus ( the sky ) , while the sea - gods were born from her union with Pontus ( the sea ) .

Etymology The Greek word \u03b3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1 ( transliterated as gaia ) is a collateral form of \u03b3\u1fc6 ( g\u0113 , Doric \u03b3\u1fb6 ga and probably \u03b4\u1fb6 da ) meaning Earth , a word of uncertain origin . R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre - Greek origin . It , however , could be related to the Avestan word gaiia ' life ; ' cf . Av . ga\u0113\u03b8\u0101 ' ( material ) world , totality of creatures ' and ga\u0113\u03b8iia ' belonging to / residing in the worldly / material sphere , material ' ; and probably even Av , gairi ' mountain ' . In Mycenean Greek Ma - ka ( trans . as Ma - ga , \" Mother Gaia \" ) also contains the root ga - . Greek mythology Hesiod Hesiod ' s Theogony tells how , after Chaos , \" wide - bosomed \" Gaia ( Earth ) arose to be the everlasting seat of the immortals who possess Olympus above , and the depths of Tartarus below ( as some scholars interpret it ) . He then tells that Gaia brought forth her equal Uranus ( Heaven , Sky ) to \" cover her on every side \" and to be the abode of the gods . Gaia also bore the hills ( ourea ) , and Pontus ( Sea ) , \" without sweet union of love \" ( i.e. , with no father ) . Afterwards with Uranus she gave birth to the Titans , as Hesiod tells it :",

As each of the Cyclopes and Hecatonchires were born , Uranus hid them in a secret place within Gaia , causing her great pain . So Gaia devised a plan . She created a grey flint ( or adamantine ) sickle . And Cronus used the sickle to castrate his father Uranus as he approached Gaia to have sex with her . From Uranus ' spilled blood , Gaia produced the Erinyes , the Giants and the Meliae ( ash - tree nymphs ) . From the testicles of Uranus in the sea came forth Aphrodite . By her son Pontus , Gaia bore the sea - deities Nereus , Thaumas , Phorcys , Ceto , and Eurybia . Because Cronus had learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overthrown by one of his children , he swallowed each of the children born to him by his Titan sister Rhea . But when Rhea was pregnant with her youngest child , Zeus , she sought help from Gaia and Uranus . When Zeus was born , Rhea gave Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling - clothes in his place , which Cronus swallowed , and Gaia took the child into her care . With the help of Gaia ' s advice , Zeus defeated the Titans . But afterwards , Gaia , in union with Tartarus , bore the youngest of her sons Typhon , who would be the last challenge to the authority of Zeus . Other sources According to Hyginus , Earth ( Gaia ) , along with Heaven and Sea were the children of Aether and Day ( Hemera ) . According to Apollodorus , Gaia and Tartarus were the parents of Echidna . Zeus hid Elara , one of his lovers , from Hera by stowing her under the earth . His son by Elara , the giant Tityos , is therefore sometimes said to be a son of Gaia , the earth goddess .",

Hera punished Apollo for this by sending him to King Admetus as a shepherd for nine years . In classical art Gaia was represented in one of two ways . In Athenian vase painting she was shown as a matronly woman only half risen from the earth , often in the act of handing the baby Erichthonius ( a future king of Athens ) to Athena to foster ( see example below ) . In mosaic representations , she appears as a woman reclining upon the earth surrounded by a host of Carpi , infant gods of the fruits of the earth ( see example below ) . Gaia also made Aristaeus immortal . Oaths sworn in the name of Gaia , in ancient Greece , were considered the most binding of all . She was also worshipped under the epithet \" Anesidora \" , which means \" giver of gifts \" .

In fact , literary and archaeological sources integrate , sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict ; however , in many cases , the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots . Literary sources Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature . Nevertheless , the only general mythographical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity was the Library of Pseudo - Apollodorus . This work attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets and provides a grand summary of traditional Greek mythology and heroic legends . Apollodorus of Athens lived from c. 180 \u2013 125 BC and wrote on many of these topics . His writings may have formed the basis for the collection ; however the \" Library \" discusses events that occurred long after his death , hence the name Pseudo - Apollodorus . Among the earliest literary sources are Homer ' s two epic poems , the Iliad and the Odyssey . Other poets completed the \" epic cycle \" , but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely . Despite their traditional name , the \" Homeric Hymns \" have no direct connection with Homer . They are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so - called Lyric age . Hesiod , a possible contemporary with Homer , offers in his Theogony ( Origin of the Gods ) the fullest account of the earliest Greek myths , dealing with the creation of the world ; the origin of the gods , Titans , and Giants ; as well as elaborate genealogies , folktales , and etiological myths . Hesiod ' s Works and Days , a didactic poem about farming life , also includes the myths of Prometheus , Pandora , and the Five Ages . The poet gives advice on the best way to succeed in a dangerous world , rendered yet more dangerous by its gods .",

Recordings made by the group in Chicago in 1926 \u2013 27 , such as \" Black Bottom Stomp \" , \" Smoke - House Blues \" and \" Doctor Jazz \" set a standard for small group jazz that is still unrivaled . Morton ' s skills as a composer and arranger are apparent in the structure of the pieces , which combines clarity with variety and manages to maintain a balance between ensemble and solo playing while allowing for a substantial solo from every band member . The quality of the recordings is further enhanced by the band ' s careful rehearsals , which were uncommon in early jazz performances . A number of Morton ' s best piano solos can also be heard on these recordings . In 1928 , Morton moved to New York , where he continued to make recordings under the name Red Hot Peppers , but collaborated with musicians from his regular band or from other orchestras . By 1930 , the name Red Hot Peppers was no longer used . Recordings made by the Red Hot Peppers constituted a significant contribution to the race records industry , at its height in the 1920s and 1930s . The masterful blend of composition and improvisation demonstrated by Morton and his colleagues set a precedent for early jazz .

When it first launched the internal conflict in Peru in 1980 , its stated goal was to replace what it saw as bourgeois democracy with \" New Democracy \" . The Shining Path believed that by establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat , inducing cultural revolution , and eventually sparking world revolution , they could arrive at pure communism . Their representatives said that existing socialist countries were revisionist , and they claimed to be the vanguard of the world communist movement . The Shining Path ' s ideology and tactics have been influential among other Maoist insurgent groups , notably the Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) and other Revolutionary Internationalist Movement - affiliated organizations . Widely condemned for its brutality , [ http : / / www.britannica.com / eb / article - 9067404 / \" Shining - Path \" ] , Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica . Retrieved June 11 , 2009 including violence deployed against peasants , trade union organizers , popularly elected officials and the general civilian population , the Shining Path is classified by the Peruvian government , the U.S. , the European Union , and Canada as a terrorist organization . Since the capture of its leader Abimael Guzm\u00e1n in 1992 , the Shining Path has declined in activity . Similar to militant groups in Colombia , some factions of the Shining Path have functioned as a highly efficient cocaine - smuggling operation , with an ostensibly paternalistic relationship to villagers.Simon Romero , [ http : / / www.nytimes.com / 2009 / 03 / 18 / world / americas / 18peru.html ? _r 1 \" Cocaine Trade Helps Rebels Reignite War in Peru \" ] , The New York Times , March 17 , 2009 Name The common name of this group , Shining Path , distinguishes it from several other Peruvian communist parties with similar names ( see Communism in Peru ) . The name is derived from a maxim of Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui , founder of the original Peruvian Communist Party in the 1920s : \" El Marxismo - Leninismo abrir\u00e1 el sendero luminoso hacia la revoluci\u00f3n \" ( \" Marxism \u2013 Leninism will open the shining path to revolution \" ) . This maxim was featured in the masthead of the newspaper of a Shining Path front group . Peruvian communist groups are often distinguished by the names of their publications . The followers of this group are generally called senderistas . All documents , periodicals and other materials produced by the organization are signed by the Communist Party of Peru ( PCP ) .

His teachings created the foundation of its militant Maoist doctrine . It was an offshoot of the Communist Party of Peru \u2013 Bandera Roja ( red flag ) , which in turn split from the original Peruvian Communist Party , a derivation of the Peruvian Socialist Party founded by Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui in 1928 . The Shining Path first established a foothold at San Crist\u00f3bal of Huamanga University , in Ayacucho , where Guzm\u00e1n taught philosophy . The university had recently reopened after being closed for about half a century , and many students of the newly educated class adopted the Shining Path ' s radical ideology . Between 1973 and 1975 , Shining Path members gained control of the student councils in the Universities of Huancayo and La Cantuta , and developed a significant presence in the National University of Engineering in Lima and the National University of San Marcos . Sometime later , it lost many student elections in the universities , including Guzm\u00e1n ' s San Crist\u00f3bal of Huamanga . It decided to abandon recruiting at the universities and reconsolidate . Beginning on March 17 , 1980 , the Shining Path held a series of clandestine meetings in Ayacucho , known as the Central Committee ' s second plenary . It formed a \" Revolutionary Directorate \" that was political and military in nature and ordered its militias to transfer to strategic areas in the provinces to start the \" armed struggle \" , despite the revisionism instituted in China by Deng Xiaoping and its economic success since 1978 . The group also held its \" First Military School \" where members were instructed in military tactics and in the use of weapons . They also engaged in \" Criticism and Self - criticism \" , a Maoist practice intended to purge bad habits and to avoid the repetition of mistakes , but the indiscriminate killings were their first mistakes , which caused the population ' s fear but not their support ( Lucanamarca ) . During the existence of the First Military School , members of the Central Committee came under heavy criticism . Guzm\u00e1n did not , and he emerged from the First Military School as the clear leader of the Shining Path . Guerrilla war",

                    "context": "When Peru ' s military government allowed elections for the first time in a dozen years in 1980 , the Shining Path was one of the few leftist political groups that declined to take part . It chose to begin guerrilla war in the highlands of Ayacucho Region . On May 17 , 1980 , on the eve of the presidential elections , it burned ballot boxes in the town of Chuschi . It was the first \" act of war \" by the Shining Path . The perpetrators were quickly caught and additional ballots were shipped to Chuschi . The elections proceeded without further problems , and the incident received little attention in the Peruvian press . Throughout the 1980s , the Shining Path grew , both in terms of the territory it controlled , and in the number of militants in its organization , particularly in the Andean highlands . It gained support from local peasants by filling the political void left by the central government and providing \" popular justice \" . This caused the peasantry of many Peruvian villages to express some sympathy for the Shining Path , especially in the impoverished and neglected regions of Ayacucho , Apur\u00edmac , and Huancavelica . At times , the civilian population of small , neglected towns participated in popular trials , especially when the victims of the trials were widely disliked . The Shining Path ' s credibility was helped by the government ' s initially tepid response to the insurgency . For over a year , the government refused to declare a state of emergency in the region where the Shining Path was operating . The Interior Minister , Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de la Jara , believed the group could be easily defeated through police actions . Additionally , the president , Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry , who returned to power in 1980 , was reluctant to cede authority to the armed forces , as his first government had ended in a military coup . The result was that the peasants in the areas where the Shining Path was active thought the state was either impotent or not interested in their issues .",

Police , military forces , and members of the Popular Guerrilla Army ( Ej\u00e9rcito Guerrillero Popular , or EGP ) carried out several massacres throughout the conflict . Military personnel took to wearing black ski - masks to hide their identities and protect their safety , and that of their families . The masks were intimidating , however , and also hid the identities of military personnel as they committed crimes . In some areas , the military trained peasants and organized them into anti - rebel militias , called \" rondas \" . They were generally poorly - equipped , despite being provided arms by the state . The rondas attacked the Shining Path guerrillas . The first such reported attack was in January 1983 , near Huata , when \" ronderos \" killed 13 \" senderistas \" in February , in Sacsamarca . In March 1983 , ronderos brutally killed Olegario Curitomay , one of the commanders of the town of Lucanamarca .

In April 2009 , the Shining Path ambushed and killed 13 government soldiers in Ayacucho . Grenades and dynamite were used in the attack . The dead included eleven soldiers and one captain , and two soldiers were also injured , with one reported missing . Poor communications were said to have made relay of the news difficult . The country ' s Defence Minister , Antero Flores Ar\u00e1oz claimed many soldiers \" plunged over a cliff \" . His Prime Minister Yehude Simon said these attacks were \" desperate responses by the Shining Path in the face of advances by the armed forces \" , and expressed his belief that the area would soon be freed of \" leftover terrorists \" .

As a Maoist organization , it strongly opposed all forms of capitalism . It followed Mao ' s dictum that guerrilla warfare should start in the countryside and gradually choke off the cities . As the peasants ' livelihoods depended on trade in the markets , they rejected such closures . In several areas of Peru , the Shining Path launched unpopular restrictive campaigns , such as a prohibition on parties and the consumption of alcohol . Government response and abuses In 1991 , President Alberto Fujimori issued a law that gave the rondas a legal status , and from that time they were officially called Comit\u00e9s de auto defensa ( \" Committees of Self Defence \" ) . They were officially armed , usually with 12 - gauge shotguns , and trained by the Peruvian Army . According to the government , there were approximately 7,226 comit\u00e9s de auto defensa as of 2005 ; almost 4,000 are located in the central region of Peru , the stronghold of the Shining Path . The Peruvian government also cracked down on the Shining Path in other ways . Military personnel were dispatched to areas dominated by the Shining Path , especially Ayacucho , to fight the rebels . Ayacucho itself was declared an emergency zone , and constitutional rights were suspended in the area . Initial government efforts to fight the Shining Path were not very effective or promising . Military units engaged in many human rights violations , which caused the Shining Path to appear in the eyes of many as the lesser of two evils . They used excessive force and killed many innocent civilians . Government forces destroyed villages and killed campesinos suspected of supporting the Shining Path . They eventually lessened the pace at which the armed forces committed atrocities such as massacres . Additionally , the state began the widespread use of intelligence agencies in its fight against the Shining Path . However , atrocities were committed by the National Intelligence Service and the Army Intelligence Service , notably the La Cantuta massacre and the Barrios Altos massacre , both of which were committed by Grupo Colina .",

Holly George - Warren of Rolling Stone commented : \" Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source . Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion , but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled , fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began . \" Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously . In 1967 , readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year , and in 1968 , Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year . Disc and Music Echo honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970 , Guitar Player named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year . The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 . Rolling Stone ranked the band ' s three studio albums , Are You Experienced , Axis : Bold as Love , and Electric Ladyland , among the 100 greatest albums of all time , and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time .

He earnestly applied himself , playing the instrument for several hours daily , watching others and getting tips from more experienced guitarists , and listening to blues artists such as Muddy Waters , B.B . King , Howlin ' Wolf , and Robert Johnson . The first tune Hendrix learned how to play was the theme from Peter Gunn .

His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties , which led to verbal taunting and physical abuse from his peers , who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return .

Performing in Little Richard ' s ensemble band , he backed up vocalists Buddy and Stacy on \" Shotgun \" . The video recording of the show marks the earliest known footage of Hendrix performing . Richard and Hendrix often clashed over tardiness , wardrobe , and Hendrix ' s stage antics , and in late July , Richard ' s brother Robert fired him . He then briefly rejoined the Isley Brothers , and recorded a second single with them , \" Move Over and Let Me Dance \" backed with \" Have You Ever Been Disappointed \" . Later that year , he joined a New York - based R & B band , Curtis Knight and the Squires , after meeting Knight in the lobby of a hotel where both men were staying . Hendrix performed with them for eight months . In October 1965 , he and Knight recorded the single , \" How Would You Feel \" backed with \" Welcome Home \" and on October 15 , Hendrix signed a three - year recording contract with entrepreneur Ed Chalpin . While the relationship with Chalpin was short - lived , his contract remained in force , which later caused legal and career problems for Hendrix . During his time with Knight , Hendrix briefly toured with Joey Dee and the Starliters , and worked with King Curtis on several recordings including Ray Sharpe ' s two - part single , \" Help Me \" . Hendrix earned his first composer credits for two instrumentals , \" Hornets Nest \" and \" Knock Yourself Out \" , released as a Curtis Knight and the Squires single in 1966 . Feeling restricted by his experiences as an R & B sideman , Hendrix moved to New York City ' s Greenwich Village in 1966 , which had a vibrant and diverse music scene . There , he was offered a residency at the Cafe Wha ? on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June , Jimmy James and the Blue Flames , which included future Spirit guitarist Randy California . The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and material that he would soon use with the Experience . In September , they gave some of their last concerts at the Cafe au Go Go , as John Hammond Jr. ' s backing group . The Jimi Hendrix Experience",

The car was designed by John Ackroyd and driven by Richard Noble . The project began with a budget of only \u00a3 175 . On 4 October 1983 the car reached a top speed of and broke the record at ( average speed of two runs within one hour ) . This was achieved at the Black Rock Desert in Nevada , USA . It is powered by a single Rolls - Royce Avon jet engine sourced from an English Electric Lightning , and has a configuration somewhat resembling that of the mid - 1960s - era J79 turbojet - powered land speed record cars of Art Arfons , collectively known as the \" Green Monster \" cars . KTVN TV ( Reno , Nevada ) reporter / photographers Michael Hagerty and Gary Martin covered the record setting attempt in the days leading up to the record . The car was unceremoniously stored under a tarp in the only automotive garage at Black Rock desert when it was n ' t being worked on by the team . A propane torch was used to burn the line straight down the hard cracked dirt of the desert for the driver to follow . No other cars were allowed to approach the race track except on the perpendicular lest the driver accidentally follow those car tracks as a different path through the measured mile . In 1997 Thrust2 ' s record was broken by Richard Noble ' s follow up car , ThrustSSC . ( Top speed - 1,228 kmph ) When the car was offered for sale at \u00a3 90,000 in 1991 , an extensive fundraising campaign was organised without government assistance to keep the car in Britain . The bid was successful , and today Thrust2 and its successor , ThrustSSC , are displayed at the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry , England .",

Thrust SSC holds the World Land Speed Record , set on 15 October 1997 , when it achieved a speed of 1228 km / h and became the first car to officially break the sound barrier . Details The car was driven by Royal Air Force fighter pilot Wing Commander Andy Green in the Black Rock Desert in the state of Nevada . It was powered by two afterburning Rolls - Royce Spey turbofan engines , as used in the British version of the F - 4 Phantom II jet fighter . The car was 16.5 m ( 54 ft ) long , 3.7 m ( 12 ft ) wide and weighed 10.5 tons ( 10.7 t ) , and the twin engines developed a net thrust of 223 kN ( 50,000 lbf ) , a power output of 110,000 bhp ( 82MW ) , burning around 18 litres / second ( 4.0 Imperial gallons / s or 4.8 US gallons / s ) . Transformed into the usual terms for car mileages based on its maximum speed , the fuel consumption was about 5500 l / 100 km . The record run in October 1997 was preceded by extensive test runs of the vehicle in autumn 1996 and spring 1997 in the Al - Jafr desert ( located in Ma ' an Governorate ) in Jordan , a location unknown before for its capabilities as a test range for high speed land vehicles , with numerous advantages compared to the salt deserts of the Western United States . After the record was set , the World Motor Sport Council released the following message : The World Motor Sport Council homologated the new world land speed records set by the team ThrustSSC of Richard Noble , driver Andy Green , on 15 October 1997 at Black Rock Desert , Nevada ( USA ) . This is the first time in history that a land vehicle has exceeded the speed of sound . The new records are as follows : *Flying mile 1227.985 km / h ( 763.035 mph ) *Flying kilometre 1223.657 km / h ( 760.343 mph ) In setting the record , the sound barrier was broken in both the north and south runs . : : : Paris , 11 November 1997 .

Richard Noble claimed that the car was a representation of Thrust SSC and thus these companies had used his intellectual property without permission , putting the future of the Bloodhound SSC project in doubt . The Advertising Standards Authority rejected the Bloodhound team ' s complaint , claiming that intellectual property disputes were not in its remit . According to BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan - Jones , Intel and Orange responded that their production team had researched different styles of \" superfast vehicles \" and developed their own Orange - branded land speed car , and that the advertisement and phone were not connected to Noble or Bloodhound SSC .",

Local radio DJ \" Sheriff Tex \" Davis arranged for this to be demo - ed and this secured him a contract with Capitol Records . He signed a publishing contract with Bill Lowery of The Lowery Group of music publishers in Atlanta , Georgia . \" Be - Bop - A - Lula \" was not on Vincent ' s first album and was picked by Capitol producer Ken Nelson as the B side of his first single . Prior to the release of the single , Lowery pressed promotional copies of \" Be - Bop - A - Lula \" and sent them to radio stations throughout the country . By the time Capitol released the single , \" Be - Bop - A - Lula \" had already gained attention from the public and radio DJs . The song was picked up and played by other U.S. radio stations ( obscuring the original \" A - side \" song ) , and became a hit and launched Vincent as a rock ' n ' roll star . After \" Be - Bop - A - Lula \" became a hit ( peaking at No . 5 and spending 20 weeks on the Billboard Pop Chart , and No . 5 and 17 weeks in the Cashbox Chart ) , Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps were unable to follow it up with the same level of commercial success , but released critically acclaimed songs like \" Race with the Devil \" ( No . 96 in Billboard and No . 50 in Cashbox ) and \" Bluejean Bop \" ( No . 49 in Billboard , and another million selling disc ) .",

Due to the overwhelming success of this tour , Vincent subsequently moved to Britain in 1963 . The accompanying band , Sounds Incorporated , a six - piece outfit which included three saxophones , guitar , bass and drums , later went on to play with the Beatles at their Shea Stadium concert . He toured the UK again in 1963 with the Outlaws , featuring future Deep Purple guitar player Ritchie Blackmore , as a backing band . Vincent ' s alcohol problems marred the tour , resulting in problems both on stage and with the band and management . Later career Vincent ' s attempts to re - establish his American career in folk rock and country rock proved unsuccessful ; he is remembered today for recordings of the 1950s and early 1960s that appeared on the Capitol label . In the early sixties , he also put out tracks on EMI ' s Columbia label ( the British label , not the U.S. CBS / Columbia ) , including a cover of Arthur Alexander ' s \" Where Have You Been All My Life ? \" . A backing band called the Shouts joined him . In 1966 and 1967 , in the States , he recorded for Challenge Records , backed by ex - members of the Champs and Glen Campbell . Challenge released three singles in the US , and the UK London label released two singles and collected recordings on to an LP , Gene Vincent , on the UK London label in 1967 . Although well received , none sold well . In 1968 in a hotel in Germany , Gene Vincent tried to shoot Gary Glitter , whom he suspected of getting too close to his girlfriend . Vincent fired several shots and missed and a frightened Glitter left the country the next day . Vincent did manage to kick Glitter ' s backside as he ran away . In 1969 , he recorded the album I ' m Back and I ' m Proud for long - time fan John Peel ' s Dandelion label , produced by Kim Fowley with arrangements by the Byrds ' Skip Battin and backing vocals by Linda Ronstadt . He recorded two other albums for the Kama Sutra label , reissued on one CD by Rev - Ola in March 2008 .",

                    "context": "The Marshall Plan ( officially the European Recovery Program , ERP ) was an American initiative to aid Western Europe , in which the United States gave over $ 12 billion ( approximately $ 120 billion in current dollar value as of June 2016 ) in economic support to help rebuild Western European economies after the end of World War II . The plan was in operation for four years beginning April 8th 1948 . The goals of the United States were to rebuild war - devastated regions , remove trade barriers , modernize industry , make Europe prosperous again , and prevent the spread of communism . The Marshall Plan required a lessening of interstate barriers , a dropping of many regulations , and encouraged an increase in productivity , labour union membership , as well as the adoption of modern business procedures . The Marshall Plan aid was divided amongst the participant states roughly on a per capita basis . A larger amount was given to the major industrial powers , as the prevailing opinion was that their resuscitation was essential for general European revival . Somewhat more aid per capita was also directed towards the Allied nations , with less for those that had been part of the Axis or remained neutral . The largest recipient of Marshall Plan money was the United Kingdom ( receiving about 26 % of the total ) , followed by France ( 18 % ) and West Germany ( 11 % ) . Some 18 European countries received Plan benefits . Although offered participation , the Soviet Union refused Plan benefits , and also blocked benefits to Eastern Bloc countries , such as East Germany and Poland . The United States provided similar aid programs in Asia , but they were not called \" Marshall Plan \" . The initiative is named after Secretary of State George Marshall . The plan had bipartisan support in Washington , where the Republicans controlled Congress and the Democrats controlled the White House with Harry S. Truman as president . The Plan was largely the creation of State Department officials , especially William L. Clayton and George F. Kennan , with help from the Brookings Institution , as requested by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . Marshall spoke of an urgent need to help the European recovery in his address at Harvard University in June 1947 . The purpose of the Marshall Plan was to aid in the economic recovery of nations after WWII as well as to antagonize the Soviet Union . In order to combat the effects of the Marshall Plan , the USSR developed its own economic plan , known as the Molotov Plan .",

Development and deployment The reconstruction plan , developed at a meeting of the participating European states , was drafted on June 5 , 1947 . It offered the same aid to the Soviet Union and its allies , but they refused to accept it , as doing so would allow a degree of US control over the Communist economies . In fact , the Soviet Union prevented its satellite states ( i.e. , East Germany , Poland , etc . ) from accepting . Secretary Marshall became convinced Stalin had no interest in helping restore economic health in Western Europe . President Harry Truman signed the Marshall Plan on April 3 , 1948 , granting $ 5 billion in aid to 16 European nations . During the four years the plan was in effect , the United States donated $ 13 billion in economic and technical assistance to help the recovery of the European countries that joined the Organization for European Economic Co - operation . In 2013 , the equivalent sum reflecting currency inflation since 1948 was roughly $ 148 billion . The $ 13 billion was in the context of a US GDP of $ 258 billion in 1948 , and on top of $ 13 billion in American aid to Europe between the end of the war and the start of the Plan that is counted separately from the Marshall Plan . The Marshall Plan was replaced by the Mutual Security Plan at the end of 1951 ; that new plan gave away about $ 7 billion annually until 1961 when it was replaced by another program . The ERP addressed each of the obstacles to postwar recovery . The plan looked to the future , and did not focus on the destruction caused by the war . Much more important were efforts to modernize European industrial and business practices using high - efficiency American models , reducing artificial trade barriers , and instilling a sense of hope and self - reliance . By 1952 , as the funding ended , the economy of every participant state had surpassed pre - war levels ; for all Marshall Plan recipients , output in 1951 was at least 35 % higher than in 1938 . Over the next two decades , Western Europe enjoyed unprecedented growth and prosperity , but economists are not sure what proportion was due directly to the ERP , what proportion indirectly , and how much would have happened without it .",

The Marshall Plan was one of the first elements of European integration , as it erased trade barriers and set up institutions to coordinate the economy on a continental level \u2013 that is , it stimulated the total political reconstruction of western Europe . Belgian economic historian Herman Van der Wee concludes the Marshall Plan was a \" great success \" : Wartime destruction By the end of World War II , much of Europe was devastated . Sustained aerial bombardment during the war had badly damaged most major cities , and industrial facilities were especially hard - hit . The region ' s trade flows had been thoroughly disrupted ; millions were in refugee camps living on aid from United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and other agencies . Food shortages were severe , especially in the harsh winter of 1946 \u2013 1947 . From July 1945 through June 1946 , the United States shipped 16.5 million tons of food , primarily wheat , to Europe and Japan . It amounted to 1 / 6 of the American food supply , and provided 35 trillion calories , enough to provide 400 calories a day for one year to 300 million people . Especially damaged was transportation infrastructure , as railways , bridges , and docks had been specifically targeted by air strikes , while much merchant shipping had been sunk . Although most small towns and villages had not suffered as much damage , the destruction of transportation left them economically isolated . None of these problems could be easily remedied , as most nations engaged in the war had exhausted their treasuries in the process . The only major powers whose infrastructure had not been significantly harmed in World War II were the United States and Canada . They were much more prosperous than before the war but exports were a small factor in their economy . Much of the Marshall Plan aid would be used by the Europeans to buy manufactured goods and raw materials from the United States and Canada . Initial post - war events Slow recovery",

In 1947 the European economies were still well below their pre - war levels and were showing few signs of growth . Agricultural production was 83 % of 1938 levels , industrial production was 88 % , and exports only 59 % . In Britain the situation was not as severe . In Germany in 1945 \u2013 46 housing and food conditions were bad , as the disruption of transport , markets and finances slowed a return to normality . In the West , bombing had destroyed 5,000,000 houses and apartments , and 12,000,000 refugees from the east had crowded in . Food production was only two - thirds of the pre - war level in 1946 \u2013 48 , while normal grain and meat shipments no longer arrived from the East . The drop in food production can be attributed to a drought that killed a major portion of the wheat crop while a severe winter destroyed the majority of the wheat crop the following year . This caused most Europeans to rely on a 1,500 calorie per day diet . Furthermore , the large shipments of food stolen from occupied nations during the war no longer reached Germany . Industrial production fell more than half and reached pre - war levels only at the end of 1949 . While Germany struggled to recover from the destruction of the War , the recovery effort began in June 1948 , moving on from emergency relief . The currency reform in 1948 was headed by the military government and helped Germany to restore stability by encouraging production . The reform revalued old currency and deposits and introduced new currency . Taxes were also reduced and Germany prepared to remove economic barriers . During the first three years of occupation of Germany the UK and US vigorously pursued a military disarmament program in Germany , partly by removal of equipment but mainly through an import embargo on raw materials , part of the Morgenthau Plan approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Nicholas Balabkins concludes that \" as long as German industrial capacity was kept idle the economic recovery of Europe was delayed . \" By July 1947 Washington realized that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base , deciding that an \" orderly , prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany . \" In addition , the strength of Moscow - controlled communist parties in France and Italy worried Washington .",

This way , the European visitors would be able to return to their home countries and implement the technologies used in the United States . The analyses in the Factory Performance Reports and the \" hands - on \" experience had by the European productivity teams effectively identified productivity deficiencies in European industries ; from there , it became clearer how to make European production more effective . Before the Technical Assistance Program even went into effect , Maurice Tobin ( the United States Secretary of Labor ) expressed his confidence in American productivity and technology to both American and European economic leaders . He urged that the United States play a large role in improving European productive efficiency by providing four recommendations for the program ' s administrators : # That BLS productivity personnel should serve on American - European councils for productivity ; # that productivity targets ( based on American productivity standards ) can and should be implemented to increase productivity ; # that there should be a general exchange and publication of information ; and # that the \" technical abstract \" service should be the central source of information . The effects of the Technical Assistance Program were not limited to improvements in productive efficiency . While the thousands of European leaders took their work / study trips to the United States , they were able to observe a number of aspects of American society as well . The Europeans could watch local , state , and federal governments work together with citizens in a pluralist society . They observed a democratic society with open universities and civic societies in addition to more advanced factories and manufacturing plants . The Technical Assistance Program allowed Europeans to bring home many types of American ideas . Another important aspect of the Technical Assistance Program was its low cost .

                    "context": "The Marshall Plan also played an important role in European integration . Both the Americans and many of the European leaders felt that European integration was necessary to secure the peace and prosperity of Europe , and thus used Marshall Plan guidelines to foster integration . In some ways this effort failed , as the OEEC never grew to be more than an agent of economic cooperation . Rather it was the separate European Coal and Steel Community , which notably excluded Britain , that would eventually grow into the European Union . However , the OEEC served as both a testing and training ground for the structures that would later be used by the European Economic Community . The Marshall Plan , linked into the Bretton Woods system , also mandated free trade throughout the region . While some historians today feel some of the praise for the Marshall Plan is exaggerated , it is still viewed favorably and many thus feel that a similar project would help other areas of the world . After the fall of communism several proposed a \" Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe \" that would help revive that region . Others have proposed a Marshall Plan for Africa to help that continent , and U.S. vice president Al Gore suggested a Global Marshall Plan . \" Marshall Plan \" has become a metaphor for any very large scale government program that is designed to solve a specific social problem . It is usually used when calling for federal spending to correct a perceived failure of the private sector . Repayment The Organization for European Economic Cooperation took the leading role in allocating funds , and the OEEC arranged for the transfer of the goods . The American supplier was paid in dollars , which were credited against the appropriate European Recovery Program funds . The European recipient , however , was not given the goods as a gift , but had to pay for them ( usually on credit ) in local currency . These payments were kept by the European government involved in a special counterpart fund . This counterpart money , in turn , could be used by the government for further investment projects . 5 % of the counterpart money was paid to the U.S. to cover the administrative costs of the ERP . The Marshall Plan money was in the form of grants that did not have to be repaid . In addition to ERP grants , the Export - Import Bank ( an agency of the U.S. government ) at the same time made long - term loans at low interest rates to finance major purchases in the US , all of which were repaid .",

To clarify the US ' s position , a major address by Secretary of State George Marshall was planned . Marshall gave the address to the graduating class of Harvard University on June 5 , 1947 . Standing on the steps of Memorial Church in Harvard Yard , he offered American aid to promote European recovery and reconstruction . The speech described the dysfunction of the European economy and presented a rationale for US aid . The modern system of the division of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down . ... Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned , the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all . It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world , without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace . Our policy is not directed against any country , but against hunger , poverty , desperation and chaos . Any government that is willing to assist in recovery will find full co - operation on the part of the USA . Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist . Marshall was convinced that economic stability would provide political stability in Europe . He offered aid , but the European countries had to organize the program themselves . The speech , written by Charles Bohlen , contained virtually no details and no numbers . More a proposal than a plan , it was a challenge to European leaders to cooperate and coordinate . It asked Europeans to create their own plan for rebuilding Europe , indicating the United States would then fund this plan . The administration felt that the plan would likely be unpopular among many Americans , and the speech was mainly directed at a European audience . In an attempt to keep the speech out of American papers journalists were not contacted , and on the same day Truman called a press conference to take away headlines . In contrast , Dean Acheson , an Under Secretary of State , was dispatched to contact the European media , especially the British media , and the speech was read in its entirety on the BBC .

The Special Fund , then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry , was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971 . In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion . Through the revolving loan system , the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low - interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion . The other 40 % of the counterpart funds were used to pay down the debt , stabilize the currency , or invest in non - industrial projects . France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds , using them to reduce the budget deficit . In France , and most other countries , the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues , and not recycled as in Germany . Technical Assistance Program The US Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) contributed heavily to the success of the Technical Assistance Program . The United States Congress passed a law on June 7 , 1940 that allowed the BLS to \" make continuing studies of labor productivity \" and appropriated funds for the creation of a Productivity and Technological Development Division . The BLS could then use its expertise in the field of productive efficiency to implement a productivity drive in each Western European country receiving Marshall Plan aid . By implementing technological literature surveys and organized plant visits , American economists , statisticians , and engineers were able to educate European manufacturers in statistical measurement . The goal of the statistical and technical assistance from the Americans was to increase productive efficiency of European manufacturers in all industries . In order to perform this analysis , the BLS performed two types of productivity calculations . First , they used existing data to calculate how much a worker produces per hour of work \u2013 the average output rate . Second , they compared the existing output rates in a particular country to output rates in other nations . By performing these calculations across all industries , the BLS was able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each country ' s manufacturing and industrial production . From that , the BLS could recommend technologies ( especially statistical ) that each individual nation could implement . Often , these technologies came from the United States ; by the time the Technical Assistance Program began , the United States used statistical technologies \" more than a generation ahead of what [ the Europeans ] were using \" .",

Another hit came soon after , with \" Addams Groove \" ( which appeared on both The Addams Family motion picture soundtrack and the vinyl and cassette versions of 2 Legit 2 Quit ) , which reached No . 7 in the U.S. and No . 4 in the UK . His video for the song appeared after the movie . Hammer set out on a tour for this album , but the stage show had become as lavish as his lifestyle ; loaded with singers , dancers and backup musicians , the supporting concert tour was too expensive for the album ' s sales to finance , and it was canceled partway through . In 1992 , Boyz II Men joined Hammer ' s high - profile 2 Legit 2 Quit tour as an opening act . While traveling the country , their tour manager Khalil Roundtree was murdered in Chicago , and the group ' s future performances of \" It ' s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday \" were dedicated to him . As a result of this unfortunate experience , the song would help advance their success . Other opening acts for the tour included Jodeci , and a young Mary J. Blige . The song proved to be successful in the U.S. , peaking at the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 , at No . 5 . Despite the album ' s multi - platinum certification , the sales were one - third of Please Hammer , Do n ' t Hurt ' Em .",

                    "context": "TAAG Angola Airlines E.P . ( ) is the state - owned national airline of Angola . Based in Luanda , the airline operates an all - Boeing fleet on domestic services within Angola , medium - haul services in Africa and long - haul services to Brazil , Cuba , China , Portugal and the United Arab Emirates . The airline was originally set up by the government as DTA - Divis\u00e3o dos Transportes A\u00e9reos in 1938 , rechristened TAAG Angola Airlines in 1973 , and gained flag carrier status in 1975 . It is now a member of both the International Air Transport Association and the African Airlines Association . History DTA : 1938 \u2013 1973 The origins of the carrier trace back to 1937 , when the president of Portugal \u00d3scar Carmona commended Joaquim de Almedia Baltazar to create an airline in Angola . In September 1938 , DTA - Divis\u00e3o dos Transportes A\u00e9reos was formed as a division of the Administration of Railways , Harbours , and Air Transport of Portuguese West Africa . It was owned and run by the government , which authorised the acquisition of three Dragons and two Junkers Ju 52s , yet the latter two aircraft were not delivered due to the outbreak of the Second World War . Operations began on , using De Havilland Dragon Rapide biplanes . First routes to be operated were founded by the Aero Club of Angola and included two main lines : one running between Luanda and Pointe Noire , having connections with Aeromaritime services to Europe , and the other being Luanda \u2013 Benguela \u2013 Lobito that was later extended to Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes . Flights were intermittently discontinued during World War II due to the scarcity of spare parts , but by the end of the war the airline resumed operations . Two Stinson Reliants bought from the Belgian Congo in 1944 permitted the carrier to resume coastal services . The DC - 3 and the Beech 18 joined the fleet in 1946 . In that year , a new route to Leopoldville was launched . The airline joined the International Air Transport Association in 1951 . Also this year , the company extended the Leopoldville route far east , serving Louren\u00e7o Marques , but this destination was later abandoned due to poor financial performance . DTA also operated a route linking Luanda with Louren\u00e7o Marques via Livingstone between 1951 and 1952 ; poor occupation prompted the airline to terminate the service . A 700 mi long route to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 was launched in 1956 .",

( The first and only single , \" If We Hold on Together \" , theme song from the Steven Spielberg animated film , The Land Before Time , became a huge number - one international single in Japan and currently ranks as the # 24th Best Selling International Single of All Time in Japan ) . Following this decision , Gordy offered Ross a new contract to return to Motown with the condition that she have shares in the company as a part - owner . Ross accepted the offer . Despite its heavy promotion , Diana ' s next album , Workin ' Overtime , was a critical and commercial failure . Subsequent follow - ups such as The Force Behind the Power ( 1991 ) , Take Me Higher ( 1995 ) , and Every Day Is a New Day ( 1999 ) produced similarly disappointing sales . Ross had more success overseas with the albums than she did in America . In 1991 , Ross became one of the few American artists to have headlined the annual Royal Variety Performance , when she performed a selection of her UK hits in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh at the Victoria Palace Theatre , London . \" The Force Behind the Power \" sparked an international comeback of sorts , when the album went double platinum in the UK . led by the No . 2 UK hit single \" When You Tell Me That You Love Me \" . Ross would see the album perform successfully across Europe to Japan as \" The Force Behind the Power \" went gold there . That single would be a lucky charm when a duet version with Irish group , Westlife also hit No . 2 in the UK in 2005 . The album produced an astounding 9 singles across international territories , including another Top 10 , \" One Shining Moment \" .",

Ross has sold more than 100 million records worldwide when her releases with the Supremes and as a solo artist are tallied .

Early life Diana Ross was born at Hutzel Women ' s Hospital in Detroit on March 26 , 1944 . She was the second eldest child of Ernestine ( n\u00e9e Moten ; January 27 , 1916 - October 9 , 1984 ) , a schoolteacher , and Fred Ross , Sr. ( July 4 , 1920 - November 21 , 2007 ) , a former Army soldier . Much has been made of whether her first name ends in an \" a \" or an \" e \" . According to Ross , her mother actually named her \" Diane \" but a clerical error resulted in her name being recorded as \" Diana \" on her birth certificate . Although she was sometimes listed as \" Diana \" during the first Supremes records , she introduced herself as \" Diane \" until early in the group ' s heyday . Her friends still call her \" Diane \" . Ross ' s grandfather John E. Ross , a native of Gloucester County , Virginia , was born to Washington Ross and Virginia Baytop .

In 1982 , she followed up the success of Why Do Fools Fall in Love with Silk Electric , which featured the Michael Jackson - written and - produced , \" Muscles \" , resulting in another top - ten success for Ross . The album eventually went gold on the strength of that song . In 1983 , Ross ventured further out of her earlier soul - based sound for a more pop rock - oriented sound following the release of the Ross album . Though the album featured the hit single , \" Pieces of Ice \" , whose music video garnered heavy rotation on video channel stations , except on MTV , the Ross album failed to generate any more hits and failed to go gold , dropping out of the charts as quickly as it entered . On July 21 , 1983 , Ross performed a concert in Central Park for a taped Showtime special . Proceeds of the concert would be donated to build a playground in the singer ' s name . Midway through the beginning of the show , a torrential downpour occurred . Ross tried to keep on performing , but the severe weather required that the show be stopped .

In 1968 , Phoenix ' s mother left her family in New York City and travelled across the United States , meeting John Lee Bottom while hitchhiking in northern California .

Phoenix was raised in Micanopy , Florida , a small suburb of Gainesville . They received no financial support and lived in poverty , with Phoenix stating they lived in a \" desperate situation . \" Phoenix often played guitar while he and his sister sang on street corners for money and food to support their ever - growing family . In the late 1970s , Phoenix ' s family moved in with River ' s maternal grandparents in Florida after spending a number of years in Venezuela with Children of God . Closely after their return to the United States , the family officially changed their name to Phoenix , after the mythical bird that rises from its own ashes , symbolizing a new beginning . Phoenix never attended formal school . Screenwriter Naomi Foner later commented , \" He was totally , totally without education . I mean , he could read and write , and he had an appetite for it , but he had no deep roots into any kind of sense of history or literature . \" Children of God In 1973 , the family joined a controversial Christian new religious movement called the Children of God as missionaries . The family had settled in Caracas , Venezuela , where the Children of God had stationed them to work as missionaries and fruit gatherers . Although Phoenix rarely talked about the cult , he was quoted by Arlyn Phoenix in a 1994 Esquire article as having said \" They ' re disgusting , they ' re ruining people ' s lives . \" In an interview with Details magazine in November 1991 , Phoenix stated he lost his virginity at age four while in the Children of God , \" but I ' ve blocked it out . \"",

An important contributor to the Pop art movement of the 1960s , he is considered one of the most influential British artists of the 20th century.J . Paul Getty Museum . [ http : / / www.getty.edu / art / gettyguide / artMakerDetails ? maker 3283 David Hockney . ] Retrieved 13 September 2008 . Hockney lives in Bridlington , East Riding of Yorkshire , and Kensington , London . He maintains two residences in California , where he lived on and off for over 30 years : one in Nichols Canyon , Los Angeles , and an office and archives on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood . Personal life Hockney was born in Bradford , England , to Laura and Kenneth Hockney ( a conscientious objector in the Second World War ) , the fourth of five children . He was educated at Wellington Primary School , Bradford Grammar School , Bradford College of Art ( where his teachers included Frank Lisle ) and the Royal College of Art in London , where he met R. B. Kitaj . While there , Hockney said he felt at home and took pride in his work . At the Royal College of Art , Hockney featured in the exhibition Young Contemporaries \u2013 alongside Peter Blake \u2013 that announced the arrival of British Pop art . He was associated with the movement , but his early works display expressionist elements , similar to some works by Francis Bacon . When the RCA said it would not let him graduate in 1962 , Hockney drew the sketch The Diploma in protest . He had refused to write an essay required for the final examination , saying he should be assessed solely on his artworks . Recognising his talent and growing reputation , the RCA changed its regulations and awarded the diploma . A visit to California , where he subsequently lived for many years , inspired him to make a series of paintings of swimming pools in the comparatively new acrylic medium rendered in a highly realistic style using vibrant colours . The artist moved to Los Angeles in 1964 , returned to London in 1968 , and from 1973 to 1975 lived in Paris . He moved to Los Angeles in 1978 , at first renting the canyon house he lived in and later bought the property and expanded it to include his studio . He also owned a 1,643 - square - foot beach house at 21039 Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu , which he sold in 1999 for around $ 1.5 million .",

                    "context": "In December 1985 , Hockney used the Quantel Paintbox , a computer program that allowed the artist to sketch directly onto the screen . Using the program was similar to drawing on the PET film for prints , with which he had much experience . The resulting work was featured in a BBC series that profiled a number of artists . His artwork was used on the cover of the 1989 British Telecom telephone directory for Bradford . Hockney returned more frequently to Yorkshire in the 1990s , usually every three months , to visit his mother who died in 1999 . He rarely stayed for more than two weeks until 1997 , when his friend Jonathan Silver who was terminally ill encouraged him to capture the local surroundings . He did this at first with paintings based on memory , some from his boyhood . Hockney returned to Yorkshire for longer and longer stays , and by 2005 was painting the countryside en plein air . He set up residence and an immense redbrick seaside studio , a converted industrial workspace , in the seaside town of Bridlington , about 75 miles from where he was born . The oil paintings he produced after 2005 were influenced by his intensive studies in watercolour ( for over a year in 2003 \u2013 2004 ) . He created paintings made of multiple smaller canvases \u2013 nine , 15 or more \u2013 placed together . To help him visualize work at that scale , he used digital photographic reproductions ; each day ' s work was photographed , and Hockney generally took a photographic print home .",

Sometimes , as in We Two Boys Together Clinging ( 1961 ) , named after a poem by Walt Whitman , the works refer to his love for men . Already in 1963 , he painted two men together in the painting Domestic Scene , Los Angeles , one showering while the other washes his back . In summer 1966 , while teaching at UCLA he met Peter Schlesinger , an art student who posed for paintings and drawings , and with whom he was romantically involved . On the morning of 18 March 2013 , Hockney ' s 23 - year - old assistant , Dominic Elliott , died as a result of drugs , drinking acid and alcohol at Hockney ' s Bridlington studio . Elliott was a first - and second - team player for Bridlington rugby club . It was reported that Hockney ' s partner drove Elliott to Scarborough General Hospital where he later died . Work Hockney made prints , portraits of friends , and stage designs for the Royal Court Theatre , Glyndebourne , La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City . Born with synaesthesia , he sees synesthetic colours in response to musical stimuli . This does not show up in his painting or photography artwork , but is a common underlying principle in his designs for stage sets for ballet and opera \u2013 where he bases background colours and lighting on the colours he sees while listening to the piece ' s music . Portraits Hockney painted portraits at different periods in his career . From 1968 , and for the next few years he painted friends , lovers , and relatives just under lifesize and in pictures that depicted good likenesses of his subjects . Hockney ' s own presence is often implied , since the lines of perspective converge to suggest the artist ' s point of view . Hockney has repeatedly returned to the same subjects - his parents , artist Mo McDermott ( Mo McDermott , 1976 ) , various writers he has known , fashion designers Celia Birtwell and Ossie Clark ( Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy , 1970 \u2013 71 ) , curator Henry Geldzahler , art dealer Nicholas Wilder , George Lawson and his ballet dancer lover , Wayne Sleep . On arrival in California , Hockney changed from oil to acrylic paint , applying it as smooth flat and brilliant colour . In 1965 , the print workshop Gemini G.E.L . approached him to create a series of lithographs with a Los Angeles theme . Hockney responded by creating a ready - made art collection .",

                    "context": "The \" joiners \" In the early 1980s , Hockney began to produce photo collages , which he called \" joiners \" , first using Polaroid prints and subsequently 35mm , commercially processed colour prints . Using Polaroid snaps or photolab - prints of a single subject , Hockney arranged a patchwork to make a composite image . An early photomontage was of his mother . Because the photographs are taken from different perspectives and at slightly different times , the result is work that has an affinity with Cubism , one of Hockney ' s major aims \u2013 discussing the way human vision works . Some pieces are landscapes , such as Pearblossom Highway # 2 , others portraits , such as Kasmin 1982 , and My Mother , Bolton Abbey , 1982 . Creation of the \" joiners \" occurred accidentally . He noticed in the late sixties that photographers were using cameras with wide - angle lenses . He did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted . While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles , he took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together , not intending for them to be a composition on their own . On looking at the final composition , he realized it created a narrative , as if the viewer moved through the room . He began to work more with photography after this discovery and stopped painting for a while to exclusively pursue this new technique . Frustrated with the limitations of photography and its ' one eyed ' approach , however , he returned to painting . Later work In 1976 , at Atelier Crommelynck , Hockney created a portfolio of 20 etchings , The Blue Guitar : Etchings By David Hockney Who Was Inspired By Wallace Stevens Who Was Inspired By Pablo Picasso . The etchings refer to themes in a poem by Wallace Stevens , \" The Man With The Blue Guitar \" . It was published by Petersburg Press in October 1977 . That year , Petersburg also published a book , in which the images were accompanied by the poem ' s text . Hockney was commissioned to design the cover and pages for the December 1985 issue of the French edition of Vogue . Consistent with his interest in cubism and admiration for Pablo Picasso , Hockney chose to paint Celia Birtwell ( who appears in several of his works ) from different views , as if the eye had scanned her face diagonally .",

In 1981 , he agreed to design sets and costumes for three 20th - century French works at the Metropolitan Opera House with the title Parade . The works were Parade , a ballet with music by Erik Satie ; Les mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias , an opera with libretto by Guillaume Apollinaire and music by Francis Poulenc , and L ' enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges , an opera with libretto by Colette and music by Maurice Ravel . The set for L ' enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges is a permanent installation at the Spalding House branch of the Honolulu Museum of Art . He designed sets for Puccini ' s Turandot in 1991 at the Chicago Lyric Opera and a Richard Strauss Die Frau ohne Schatten in 1992 at the Royal Opera House in London . In 1994 , he designed costumes and scenery for twelve opera arias for the TV broadcast of Pl\u00e1cido Domingo ' s Operalia in Mexico City . Technical advances allowed him to become increasingly complex in model - making . At his studio he had a proscenium opening 6 ft by 4 ft in which he built sets in 1:8 scale . He also used a computerized setup that let him punch in and program lighting cues at will and synchronize them to a soundtrack of the music . Exhibitions Hockney had his first one - man show when he was 26 in 1963 , and by 1970 the Whitechapel Gallery in London had organized the first of several major retrospectives , which subsequently travelled to three European institutions . In 2004 , he was included in the cross - generational Whitney Biennial , where his portraits appeared in a gallery with those of a younger artist he had inspired , Elizabeth Peyton . In October 2006 , the National Portrait Gallery in London organized one of the largest ever displays of Hockney ' s portraiture work , including 150 paintings , drawings , prints , sketchbooks , and photocollages from over five decades . The collection ranged from his earliest self - portraits to work he completed in 2005 . Hockney assisted in displaying the works and the exhibition , which ran until January 2007 , was one of the gallery ' s most successful . In 2009 , \" David Hockney : Just Nature \" attracted some 100,000 visitors at the Kunsthalle W\u00fcrth in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall , Germany .",

Second campaign for Mayor , 1989 : challenge to Eugene Sawyer On November 25 , 1987 , Mayor Washington died in office of a heart attack . On December 2 , 1987 , the Chicago City Council appointed Alderman Eugene Sawyer as mayor until a special election for the remaining two years of the term could be held in 1989 . Daley announced his candidacy on December 6 , 1988 , saying Let ' s face it : we have a problem in Chicago . The name - calling and politics at City Hall are keeping us from tackling the real issues ...

They get it first before we get it ? \" , referring to the post - 9 / 11 air space restrictions in place over Orlando , Florida . \" The signature act of Richard Daley ' s 22 years in office was the midnight bulldozing of Meigs Field , \" according to Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn . \" He ruined Meigs because he wanted to , because he could , \" Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass wrote of Daley . \" The issue is Daley ' s increasingly authoritarian style that brooks no disagreements , legal challenges , negotiations , compromise or any of that messy give - and - take normally associated with democratic government , \" the Chicago Tribune editorialized . The Federal Aviation Administration cited the City for failure to comply with federal law requiring thirty - day advance notice to the FAA of plans for an airport closure . The city was fined $ 33,000 , the maximum allowable . The city paid the fine and repaid $ 1 million in misspent federal airport development grants . Daley defended his actions by claiming that the airport was abandoned , in spite of the fact that the Chicago Fire Department had several helicopters based on the field at the time , in addition to the dozens of private aircraft left stranded . Hired Truck Program scandal The $ 40 million - a - year Hired Truck program was the biggest scandal of Daley ' s first 15 years as mayor . The Hired Truck Program hired private truck companies to do city work . A six - month investigation by the Chicago Sun - Times resulted in a three - day series of articles in January 2004 that revealed some participating companies were being paid for doing little or no work , had American Mafia connections or were tied to city employees , or paid bribes to get into the program . Between 1996 and 2004 , companies in the Hired Truck Program gave more than $ 800,000 in campaign contributions to various politicians , including Daley , House Speaker Michael Madigan , and Governor Rod Blagojevich ; Daley received at least $ 108,575 and his brother John Daley and his ward organization more than $ 47,500 .",

Patrick told the relatives he was staying with friends , drove his father ' s new sports utility vehicle to the Daley second home in Grand Beach , Michigan and threw a party Saturday night without parental consent or adult supervision . Someone asked two Filipino and two white youths to leave , racial epithets were exchanged , and a fistfight broke out . Patrick fetched Richard J. Daley ' s shotgun from the house and gave it to his cousin , who was aged 17 . A youth was seriously injured when a juvenile struck him in the head with a baseball bat . On Monday a sobbing Mayor Daley read a statement at a City Hall press conference , pausing repeatedly as he tried to maintain his composure , I am very disappointed , as any parent would be , after his son held a party in their home while his parents were away . I am more deeply distressed for the welfare of the young man who was injured in this fight . Patrick pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of furnishing alcohol to minors and disturbing the peace and was sentenced to six months ' probation , 50 hours of community service in Grand Beach , fined $ 1,950 and ordered to pay restitution to his parents for property damage . His cousin pleaded guilty to aiming a firearm without malice and was fined $ 1,235 . Sixteen other youths were charged with juvenile and adult offenses . The injured youth recovered . Third term ( 1995 \u2013 1999 ) Daley took control of the Chicago Public School system in 1995 and appointed Paul Vallas . When Vallas left the post to run for governor , Daley chose the relatively obscure Arne Duncan , now the U.S. Secretary of Education , to lead the district . On March 19 , 1997 , the Chicago City Council adopted the Domestic Partners Ordinance , which made employee benefits available to same - sex partners of City employees . Daley said it was an issue of fairness .",

Garbo was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Actress and received an honorary one in 1954 for her \" luminous and unforgettable screen performances . \" In 1999 , the American Film Institute ranked Garbo fifth on their list of the greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema , after Katharine Hepburn , Bette Davis , Audrey Hepburn , and Ingrid Bergman . Garbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film The Saga of Gosta Berling . Her performance caught the attention of Louis B. Mayer , chief executive of Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer ( MGM ) , who brought her to Hollywood in 1925 . She immediately stirred interest with her first silent film , Torrent , released in 1926 ; a year later , her performance in Flesh and the Devil , her third movie , made her an international star . Garbo ' s first talking film was Anna Christie ( 1930 ) . MGM marketers enticed the public with the catch - phrase \" Garbo talks ! \" That same year she starred in Romance . For her performances in these films she received the first of three Academy Award nominations for Best Actress . ( Academy rules at the time allowed for a performer to receive a single nomination for their work in more than one film . ) In 1932 , her popularity allowed her to dictate the terms of her contract and she became increasingly selective about her roles . Her success continued in films such as Mata Hari ( 1931 ) and Grand Hotel ( 1932 ) . Many critics and film historians consider her performance as the doomed courtesan Marguerite Gautier in Camille ( 1936 ) to be her finest . The role gained her a second Academy Award nomination . Garbo ' s career soon declined , however , and she was one of the many stars labeled \" Box Office Poison \" in 1938 . Her career revived upon her turn to comedy in Ninotchka ( 1939 ) , which earned her a third Academy Award nomination , but after the failure of Two - Faced Woman ( 1941 ) , she retired from the screen , at the age of 35 , after acting in twenty - eight films .",

I did not like my work . There were many days when I had to force myself to go to the studio ... I really wanted to live another life . \" Public persona From the early days of her career , Garbo avoided industry social functions , preferring to spend her time alone or with friends . She never signed autographs or answered fan mail , and rarely gave interviews . Nor did she ever appear at Oscar ceremonies even when she was nominated . Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine , and exasperating to the studio at first . In an interview in 1928 , she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was a child , stating \" as early as I can remember , I have wanted to be alone . I detest crowds , do n ' t like many people . \" But MGM eventually capitalized on it , for it bolstered the image of the silent and reclusive woman of mystery .

She directed her friends in make - believe games and performances and dreamed of becoming an actress . Later , she would participate in amateur theatre with her friends and frequent the Mosebacke Theatre . At the age of 13 , Garbo graduated from school , and , typical of a Swedish working class girl at that time , she did not attend high school .

According to author Frederick Sands , \" the result of the test was electrifying . Thalberg was impressed and began grooming the young actress the following day , arranging to fix her teeth , making sure she lost weight , and giving her English lessons . \" During her rise to stardom , film historian Mark Vieira notes that \" Thalberg decreed that henceforth Garbo would play a young but worldly - wise woman . . . \" Vieira , Mark A. Irving Thalberg : Boy Wonder to Producer Prince , Univ . of California Press pp . 70 - 71 ( 2010 ) However , according to Thalberg ' s actress wife , Norma Shearer , Garbo did not necessarily agree with his ideas : Although she expected to work with Stiller on her first film , she was cast in Torrent ( 1926 ) , an adaptation of a novel by Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez , with director Monta Bell . She replaced Aileen Pringle , ten years her senior , and played a vamp opposite Ricardo Cortez . Torrent was a hit and despite its cool reception by the trade press , Garbo ' s performance was critically acclaimed . The success led Irving Thalberg , head of production at MGM , to cast her in a similar role in The Temptress ( 1926 ) , based on another Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez novel . After only one film , she was given top billing , playing opposite Antonio Moreno . Her mentor Stiller , who had persuaded her to take the part , was assigned to direct . For both Garbo ( who did not want to play another vamp and did not like the script any more than she did the first one ) and Stiller , The Temptress was a harrowing experience . Stiller , who spoke little English , had difficulty adapting to the studio system and did not get on with Moreno , was fired by Thalberg and replaced by Fred Niblo . Reshooting The Temptress was expensive and even though it became one of the top - grossing films of the 1926 \u2013 27 season , it was the only Garbo film of the period to lose money . However , Garbo received rave reviews and MGM had a new star .",

                    "context": "After her lightning ascent , Garbo went on to make eight more silent films and all were hits . She starred in three of them with popular leading man John Gilbert . About their first movie , Flesh and the Devil ( 1926 ) , silent film expert Kevin Brownlow states that \" she gave a more erotic performance than Hollywood had ever seen . \" Their on - screen chemistry soon translated into an off - camera romance and by the end of the production , they began living together . The film also marked a turning point in Garbo ' s career . Vieira wrote : \" Audiences were mesmerized by her beauty and titillated by her love scenes with Gilbert . She was a sensation . \" Profits from her third movie with Gilbert , A Woman of Affairs ( 1928 ) , catapulted her to top Metro star of the 1928 \u2013 29 box office season , usurping the long - reigned silent queen Lillian Gish . In 1929 , reviewer Pierre de Rohan wrote in the New York Telegraph : \" She has a glamour and fascination for both sexes which have never been equaled on the screen . \" The impact of Garbo ' s acting and screen presence quickly established her reputation as one of Hollywood ' s greatest actresses . Film historian and critic David Denby argues that Garbo introduced a subtlety of expression to the art of silent acting and that its effect on audiences can not be exaggerated . She \" lowers her head to look calculating or flutters her lips , \" he says . \" Her face darkens with a slight tightening around the eyes and mouth ; she registers a passing idea with a contraction of her brows or a drooping of her lids . Worlds turned on her movements . \" During this period , Garbo began to require unusual conditions during the shooting of her scenes . She prohibited visitors \u2013 including the studio brass \u2013 from her sets and demanded that black flats or screens surround her to prevent extras and technicians from watching her . When asked about these eccentric requirements , she said \" If I am by myself , my face will do things I can not do with it otherwise . \" Despite her popularity as a silent star , the studio feared that her Swedish accent might impair her work in sound and delayed the shift for as long as possible . MGM itself was the last Hollywood studio to convert to sound and her last silent film , The Kiss ( 1929 ) , was also the studio ' s . Garbo would go on to become one of the biggest box office draws of the next decade .",

After appearing in As You Desire Me ( 1932 ) , the first of three Garbo films which co - starred Melvyn Douglas , Garbo ' s MGM contract expired and she returned to Sweden . After nearly a year of negotiations , Garbo agreed to renew her contract with MGM on the condition she would star in Queen Christina and her salary would be increased to $ 300,000 per film . The film ' s screenplay had been written by Viertel , and although MGM had been reluctant to make the movie , they relented at Garbo ' s insistence . For her leading man , MGM suggested Charles Boyer or Laurence Olivier , but Garbo rejected both , preferring her former co - star and lover , John Gilbert . The studio balked at the idea of casting Gilbert , fearing his declining popularity would hurt the film ' s profits , but Garbo prevailed . Queen Christina was a lavish production , becoming one of the studio ' s biggest productions at the time . Publicized as \" Garbo returns \" , the film premiered in December 1933 to critical acclaim and box office triumph and became the highest - grossing film of the year . The movie , however , met with controversy upon its release ; censors objected to the scenes in which Garbo disguised herself as a man and kissed a female co - star . Although her domestic popularity was undiminished in the early 1930s , high profits for Garbo ' s films after Queen Christina in 1933 depended on the foreign market for their success . The type of historical and melodramatic films she began to make on the advice of Viertel were highly successful abroad but considerably less so in the United States . In the midst of the Great Depression , American screen audiences seemed to favor \" home - grown \" screen couples , such as Clark Gable and Jean Harlow .",

Biography Lancaster was born in London , and educated at St Ronan ' s School , and then at Charterhouse and Lincoln College , Oxford . At Oxford he became friends with John Betjeman and drew cartoons for the university magazine Cherwell . He graduated with a fourth - class degree in English after an extra year beyond the normal three years of study . Intending a career in law , he failed his bar exams and instead entered the Slade School of Art in London . Lancaster initially worked alongside Betjeman at the Architectural Review . In 1936 he published Progress at Pelvis Bay , the first of his many books of social and architectural satire . In 1939 he became cartoonist at the Daily Express , where he pioneered the pocket cartoon , a single - panel , single - column topical drawing appearing on the front page , since imitated in several British newspapers . In these he sympathetically mocked the British upper classes , personified by his characters William ( 8th Earl of Littlehampton , formerly Viscount Draynflete ) and his wife Maudie . During his Express career Lancaster drew some 10,000 cartoons over a period of 40 years . During World War II , Lancaster worked in press censorship , then in Greece as a Foreign Office press attach\u00e9 . During the war years his cartoons provided comic relief from the privations of rationing and bombing raids . After the war Lancaster published Classical Landscape with Figures ( 1947 ) , The Saracen ' s Head ( 1948 ) and Drayneflete Revealed ( 1949 ) , the last dealing with the Littlehamptons ' architectural and artistic inheritances . Along with The Littlehampton Bequest ( 1973 , foreword by Sir Roy Strong ) , it provided a humorous and satirical but very well - informed , survey of architectural and aesthetic trends in British and European history . In 1951 Lancaster worked with John Piper on designs for the Festival of Britain . This was followed by stage design work for opera , ballet and theatre including productions at Sadler ' s Wells and Glyndebourne , among them Frederick Ashton ' s production of La Fille mal gard\u00e9e .",

The name was retained when the Club moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road , although no longer a true description of its location . However , in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of the ground , which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly defined . The opening of the new No . 1 Court in 1997 emphasised the description . By 1882 , activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word \" croquet \" was dropped from the title . However , for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899 . In 1884 , the club added Ladies ' Singles and Gentlemen ' s Doubles competitions . Ladies ' Doubles and Mixed Doubles events were added in 1913 . Until 1922 , the reigning champion had to play only in the final , against whomever had won through to challenge him / her . As with the other three Major or Grand Slam events , Wimbledon was contested by top - ranked amateur players , professional players were prohibited from participating . This changed with the advent of the open era in 1968 . No British man won the singles event at Wimbledon between Fred Perry in 1936 and Andy Murray in 2013 , while no British woman has won since Virginia Wade in 1977 , although Annabel Croft and Laura Robson won the Girls ' Championship in 1984 and 2008 respectively . The Championship was first televised in 1937 . Though properly called \" The Championships , Wimbledon \" , depending on sources the event is also known as \" The All England Lawn Tennis Championships \" , \" The Wimbledon Championships \" or simply \" Wimbledon \" . From 1912 to 1924 , the tournament was recognized by the International Lawn Tennis Federation as the \" World Grass Court Championships \" . 21st century",

It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon , London since 1877 . Wimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments , the others being the Australian Open , the French Open and the US Open . Since the Australian Open shifted to hardcourt in 1988 , Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass . The tournament takes place over two weeks in late June and early July , culminating with the Ladies ' and Gentlemen ' s Singles Final , scheduled always for the second Saturday and Sunday of July respectively . Five major , junior , and invitational events are held each year . Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors and Royal patronage . The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts . In 2009 , Wimbledon ' s Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain . History Beginning The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868 , originally as \" The All England Croquet Club \" . Its first ground was off Worple Road , Wimbledon . In 1876 , lawn tennis , a game devised by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield a year or so earlier and originally given the name Sphairistik\u00e8 , was added to the activities of the club . In spring 1877 , the club was renamed \" The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club \" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship . A new code of laws , replacing the code administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club , was drawn up for the event . Today ' s rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net . The inaugural 1877 Wimbledon Championship opened on 9 July 1877 . The Gentlemen ' s Singles was the only event held and was won by Spencer Gore , an old Harrovian rackets player , from a field of 22 . About 200 spectators paid one shilling each to watch the final .",

Since 2002 a seeding committee has not been required for the Gentlemen ' s Singles following an agreement with the ATP . While the seeds are still the top 32 players according to rankings , the seeding order is determined using the formula : ATP Entry System Position points + 100 % points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months + 75 % points earned for the best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that . A majority of the entrants are unseeded . Only two unseeded players have won the Gentlemen ' s Singles : Boris Becker in 1985 and Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 in 2001 . In 1985 there were only 16 seeds and Becker was ranked 20th ; Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 was ranked 125th when he won as a Wild Card entrant , although he had previously been a finalist three times , and been ranked no . 2 in the world ; his low ranking was due to having been hampered by a persistent shoulder injury for three years , which had only just cleared up . In 1996 , the title was won by Richard Krajicek , who was originally unseeded ( ranked 17th , and only 16 players were seeded ) but was promoted to a seeded position ( still with the number 17 ) when Thomas Muster withdrew before the tournament . No unseeded player has captured the Ladies ' Singles title ; the lowest seeded female champion was Venus Williams , who won in 2007 as the 23rd seed ; Williams was returning from an injury that had prevented her playing in previous tournaments , giving her a lower ranking than she would normally have had . Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous occasions ; the 2005 Gentlemen ' s Doubles champions were not only unseeded , but also ( for the first time ever ) qualifiers . Grounds Since 2001 , the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100 % perennial ryegrass . Prior to 2001 a combination of 70 % ryegrass and 30 % Creeping Red Fescue was used . The change was made to improve durability and strengthen the sward to better withstand the increasing wear of the modern game .",

To that end a long - term plan was unveiled in 1993 , intended to improve the quality of the event for spectators , players , officials and neighbours . Stage one ( 1994 \u2013 1997 ) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the new No . 1 Court in Aorangi Park , a broadcast centre , two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road . Stage two ( 1997 \u2013 2009 ) involved the removal of the old No . 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building , providing extensive facilities for players , press , officials and members , and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats . Stage three ( 2000 \u2013 2011 ) has been completed with the construction of an entrance building , club staff housing , museum , bank and ticket office . A new retractable roof was built in time for the 2009 championships , marking the first time that rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on Centre Court . The Club tested the new roof at an event called A Centre Court Celebration on Sunday , 17 May 2009 , which featured exhibition matches involving Andre Agassi , Steffi Graf , Kim Clijsters and Tim Henman . The first Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women ' s singles match between Dinara Safina and Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo . The first match to be played in its entirety under the new roof took place between Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka on 29 June 2009 , which Murray won . Murray was also involved in the match completed latest in the day at Wimbledon , which ended at 11:02 pm in a victory over Marcos Baghdatis at Centre Court in the third round of the 2012 Championships . The 2012 Men ' s Singles Final on 8 July 2012 , between Roger Federer and Murray , was the first final to be played under the roof , which was activated during the third set .

The other women ' s warm - up tournament for Wimbledon is Birmingham , also in England . The only grass - court tournament scheduled after the Championships is the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships at Newport , Rhode Island , USA , which takes place the week after Wimbledon . Wimbledon is scheduled for 14 days , beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday . The five main events span both weeks , but the junior and invitational events are held mainly during the second week . Traditionally , there is no play on the \" Middle Sunday \" , which is considered a rest day . However , rain has forced play on the Middle Sunday four times , in 1991 , 1997 , 2004 and 2016 . On each of these occasions , Wimbledon staged a \" People ' s Sunday \" , with unreserved seating and readily available , inexpensive tickets , allowing those with more limited means to sit on the show courts . Since 2015 , the championships have begun one week later than in previous years , extending the gap between the tournament and the French Open from two to three weeks . Additionally the Stuttgart Open men ' s tournament converted to a grass surface and was rescheduled from July to June , extending the grass court season . Players and seeding Both the men ' s and ladies ' singles consist of 128 players . Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings , with 104 direct entries into the men ' s and 108 into the ladies ' competitions . Both tournaments have 8 wild card entrants , with the remainder in each made up of qualifiers . Since the 2001 tournament 32 players have been given seedings in the Gentlemen ' s and Ladies ' singles , 16 teams in the doubles events . The system of seeding was introduced during the 1924 Wimbledon Championships . This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw . This system was replaced for the 1927 Wimbledon Championships and from then on players were seeded on merit . The first players to be seeded as no . 1 were Ren\u00e9 Lacoste and Helen Wills .",

Wearing white clothing with some colour accents is also acceptable , provided the colour scheme is not that of an identifiable commercial brand logo ( the outfitter ' s brand logo being the sole exception ) . Controversy followed Martina Navratilova ' s wearing branding for \" Kim \" cigarettes in 1982 . Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire , linesmen , ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships ; however , beginning with the 2006 Championships , officials , ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue - and cream - coloured uniforms from American designer Ralph Lauren . This marked the first time in the history of the Championships that an outside company was used to design Wimbledon clothing ; the contract with Polo Ralph Lauren is set to end in 2015 . Referring to players By tradition , the \" Men ' s \" and \" Women ' s \" competitions are referred to as \" Gentlemen ' s \" and \" Ladies ' \" competitions at Wimbledon . The junior competitions are referred to as the \" Boys ' \" and \" Girls ' \" competitions . Prior to 2009 female players were referred to by the title \" Miss \" or \" Mrs \" on scoreboards . As dictated by strict rule of etiquette , married female players are referred to by their husbands ' names : for example , Chris Evert - Lloyd appeared on scoreboards as \" Mrs. J. M. Lloyd \" during her marriage to John Lloyd , since \" Mrs. X \" essentially designates the wife of X . This tradition has continued at least to some extent . For the first time during the 2009 tournament , players were referred to on scoreboards by both their first and last names . The title \" Mr \" is not used for male players who are professionals on scoreboards but the prefix is retained for amateurs , although chair umpires refer to players as \" Mr \" when they use the replay challenge . The chair umpire will say \" Mr is challenging the call ... \" and \" Mr has X challenges remaining . \" However , the umpires still say Miss when announcing the score of the Ladies ' matches .",

Held in the United Kingdom , it is administered by The R & A and is the only major outside the United States . The Open is currently the third major of the year , between the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship , and is played in mid - July . The current champion is Henrik Stenson , who won the 145th Open at Royal Troon in 2016 with a record - breaking score of - 20 . History The Open was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland . The inaugural tournament was restricted to professionals and attracted a field of eight golfers who played three rounds of Prestwick ' s twelve - hole course in a single day . Willie Park Sr. won with a score of 174 , beating Old Tom Morris , by two strokes . The following year the tournament was opened to amateurs ; eight of them joined ten professionals in the field . James Ogilvie Fairlie was the principal organiser of the first Open Championship held at Prestwick in 1860 . With the untimely death of Allan Robertson , aged 43 in 1859 , Prestwick members decided to conduct a challenge the following year that would determine the land \u2019 s greatest golfer . In a proposed competition for a \" Challenge Belt \" , Fairlie sent out a series of letters to Blackheath , Perth , Edinburgh , Musselburgh and St Andrews , inviting a player known as a \" respectable caddie \" to represent each of the clubs in a tournament to be held on 17 October 1860 . Originally , the trophy presented to the event ' s winner was the Challenge Belt , a red leather belt with a silver buckle . The Challenge Belt was retired in 1870 , when Young Tom Morris was allowed to keep it for winning the tournament three consecutive times . Because no trophy was available , the tournament was cancelled in 1871 . In 1872 , after Young Tom Morris won again for a fourth time in a row , he was awarded a medal . The present trophy , The Golf Champion Trophy , better known by its popular name of the Claret Jug , was then created .",

In 1871 , it agreed to organise it jointly with The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers . In 1892 the event was doubled in length from 36 to 72 holes , four rounds of what was by then the standard complement of 18 holes . The 1894 Open was the first held outside Scotland , at the Royal St George ' s Golf Club in England . Because of an increasing number of entrants , a cut was introduced after two rounds in 1898 . In 1920 full responsibility for The Open Championship was handed over to The Royal & Ancient Golf Club . The early winners were all Scottish professionals , who in those days worked as greenkeepers , clubmakers , and caddies to supplement their modest winnings from championships and challenge matches . The Open has always been dominated by professionals , with only six victories by amateurs , all of which occurred between 1890 and 1930 . The last of these was Bobby Jones ' third Open and part of his celebrated Grand Slam . Jones was one of six Americans who won The Open between the First and Second World Wars , the first of whom had been Walter Hagen in 1922 . These Americans and the French winner of the 1907 Open , Arnaud Massy , were the only winners from outside Scotland and England up to 1939 . The first post - World War II winner was the American Sam Snead , in 1946 . In 1947 , Northern Ireland ' s Fred Daly was victorious . While there have been many English and Scottish champions , Daly was the only winner from Ireland until the 2007 victory by P\u00e1draig Harrington . There has never been a Welsh champion . In the early postwar years The Open was dominated by golfers from the Commonwealth , with South African Bobby Locke and Australian Peter Thomson winning the Claret Jug in eight of the 11 championships from 1948 and 1958 between them . During this period , The Open often had a schedule conflict with the match - play PGA Championship , which meant that Ben Hogan , the best American golfer at this time , competed in The Open just once , in 1953 at Carnoustie , a tournament he won .",

Until 2014 , the PGA Tour referred to the tournament as the British Open , and many American media outlets continue to do so . However , in 2014 , with the new Open Qualifying Series that selects players for the Open through finishes earned in various PGA Tour events , the PGA Tour has taken to referring to the event as The Open Championship for the first time . U.S. television rights - holder ESPN / ABC referred to the event as the British Open until 2004 .

In addition , all Open Championships before 1995 have been retroactively classified as PGA Tour wins , and the list of leading winners on the PGA Tour has been adjusted to reflect this . The European Tour has recognised The Open as an official event since its first official season in 1972 and it is also an official money event on the Japan Golf Tour . Prize money",

This was at the beginning of the \" Big Three \" era in professional golf , the three players in question being Player , Arnold Palmer , and Jack Nicklaus . Palmer first competed in 1960 , when he came second to the little - known Australian Kel Nagle , but he won the next two years . While he was far from being the first American to become Open Champion , he was the first that many Americans saw win the tournament on television , and his charismatic success is often credited with persuading leading American golfers to make The Open an integral part of their schedule , rather than an optional extra . The improvement of trans - Atlantic travel also increased American participation . Nicklaus ' victories came in 1966 , 1970 , and 1978 . Although his tally of three wins is the least of his majors , it greatly understates how prominent Nicklaus was at the Open throughout the 1960s and 1970s . He finished runner - up seven times , which is the record and had a total of sixteen top - 5 finishes , which is tied most in Open history with John Henry Taylor and easily the most in the postwar era . Nicklaus also holds the records for most rounds under par ( 61 ) and most aggregates under par ( 14 ) . At Turnberry in 1977 he was involved in one of the most celebrated contests in golf history , when his duel with Tom Watson went to the final shot before Watson emerged as the champion for the second time with a record score of 268 ( 12 under par ) . Watson won five Opens , more than anyone else has since the 1950s , but his final win in 1983 brought down the curtain on an era of U.S. domination . In the next 11 years there was only one American winner , with the others coming from Europe and the Commonwealth . The European winners of this era , Spaniard Seve Ballesteros , Sandy Lyle , who was the first Scottish winner in over half a century , and the Englishman Nick Faldo , were also leading lights among the group of players who began to get the better of the Americans in the Ryder Cup during this period .",

It is a subsidiary of U.S. media conglomerate Viacom . Paramount is a member of the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) . In 2014 , Paramount Pictures became the first major Hollywood studio to distribute all of its films in digital - form only . Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world , and America ' s oldest running studio , founded in 1912 . History 1911 \u2013 1920 : Early history Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world after the French studios Gaumont Film Company ( 1895 ) and Path\u00e9 ( 1896 ) , followed by the Nordisk Film company ( 1906 ) , and Universal Studios ( 1912 ) . It is the last major film studio still headquartered in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles . Paramount Pictures dates its existence from the 1912 founding date of the Famous Players Film Company . Hungarian - born founder , Adolph Zukor , who had been an early investor in nickelodeons , saw that movies appealed mainly to working - class immigrants . With partners Daniel Frohman and Charles Frohman he planned to offer feature - length films that would appeal to the middle class by featuring the leading theatrical players of the time ( leading to the slogan \" Famous Players in Famous Plays \" ) . By mid - 1913 , Famous Players had completed five films , and Zukor was on his way to success . Its first film was Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth , which starred Sarah Bernhardt . That same year , another aspiring producer , Jesse L. Lasky , opened his Lasky Feature Play Company with money borrowed from his brother - in - law , Samuel Goldfish , later known as Samuel Goldwyn . The Lasky company hired as their first employee a stage director with virtually no film experience , Cecil B. DeMille , who would find a suitable location site in Hollywood , near Los Angeles , for his first feature film , The Squaw Man .",

W. Hodkinson , who had bought and merged several smaller firms . Hodkinson and actor , director , producer Hobart Bosworth had started production of a series of Jack London movies . Paramount was the first successful nationwide distributor ; until this time , films were sold on a statewide or regional basis which had proved costly to film producers . Also , Famous Players and Lasky were privately owned while Paramount was a corporation . In 1916 , Zukor maneuvered a three - way merger of his Famous Players , the Lasky Company , and Paramount . Zukor and Lasky bought Hodkinson out of Paramount , and merged the three companies into one . The new company Lasky and Zukor founded , Famous Players - Lasky Corporation , grew quickly , with Lasky and his partners Goldwyn and DeMille running the production side , Hiram Abrams in charge of distribution , and Zukor making great plans . With only the exhibitor - owned First National as a rival , Famous Players - Lasky and its \" Paramount Pictures \" soon dominated the business . 1921 \u2013 1930 : Rise Because Zukor believed in stars , he signed and developed many of the leading early stars , including Mary Pickford , Marguerite Clark , Pauline Frederick , Douglas Fairbanks , Gloria Swanson , Rudolph Valentino , and Wallace Reid . With so many important players , Paramount was able to introduce \" block booking \" , which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star ' s films had to buy a year ' s worth of other Paramount productions . It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s , but which led the government to pursue it on antitrust grounds for more than twenty years . The driving force behind Paramount ' s rise was Zukor . Through the teens and twenties , he built the Publix Theatres Corporation , a chain of nearly 2,000 screens , ran two production studios ( in Astoria , New York , now the Kaufman Astoria Studios , and Hollywood , California ) , and became an early investor in radio , taking a 50 % interest in the new Columbia Broadcasting System in 1928 ( selling it within a few years ; this would not be the last time Paramount and CBS crossed paths ) .",

Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer would become a partner in the mid - 1970s . Both Paramount and CIC entered the video market with Paramount Home Video ( now Paramount Home Entertainment ) and CIC Video , respectively . Robert Evans abandoned his position as head of production in 1974 ; his successor , Richard Sylbert , proved to be too literary and too tasteful for Gulf + Western ' s Bluhdorn . By 1976 , a new , television - trained team was in place headed by Barry Diller and his \" Killer - Dillers \" , as they were called by admirers or \" Dillettes \" as they were called by detractors . These associates , made up of Michael Eisner , Jeffrey Katzenberg , Dawn Steel and Don Simpson would each go on and head up major movie studios of their own later in their careers . The Paramount specialty was now simpler . \" High concept \" pictures such as Saturday Night Fever and Grease hit big , hit hard and hit fast all over the world , and Diller ' s television background led him to propose one of his longest - standing ideas to the board : Paramount Television Service , a fourth commercial network . Paramount Pictures purchased the Hughes Television Network ( HTN ) including its satellite time in planning for PTVS in 1976 . Paramount sold HTN to Madison Square Garden in 1979 . But Diller believed strongly in the concept , and so took his fourth - network idea with him when he moved to 20th Century Fox in 1984 , where Fox ' s then freshly installed proprietor , Rupert Murdoch was a more interested listener . However , the television division would be playing catch - up for over a decade after Diller ' s departure in 1984 before launching its own television network \u2013 UPN \u2013 in 1995 . Lasting eleven years before being merged with The WB network to become The CW in 2006 , UPN would feature many of the shows it originally produced for other networks , and would take numerous gambles on series such as Star Trek : Voyager and Star Trek : Enterprise that would have otherwise either gone direct - to - cable or become first - run syndication to independent stations across the country ( as Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Star Trek : The Next Generation were ) .",

In the sound era , the logo was accompanied by a fanfare called Paramount on Parade after the film of the same name , released in 1930 . The words to the fanfare , originally sung in the 1930 film , were \" Proud of the crowd that will never be loud , it ' s Paramount on Parade . \" Legend has it that the mountain is based on a doodle made by W. W. Hodkinson during a meeting with Adolph Zukor . It is said to be based on the memories of his childhood in Utah . Some claim that Utah ' s Ben Lomond is the mountain Hodkinson doodled , and that Peru ' s Artesonraju is the mountain in the live - action logo , while others claim that the Italian side of Monviso inspired the logo . Some editions of the logo bear a striking resemblance to the Pfeifferhorn , another Wasatch Range peak . The motion picture logo has gone through many changes over the years : * The logo began as a somewhat indistinct charcoal rendering of the mountain ringed with superimposed stars . The logo originally had twenty - four stars , as a tribute to the then current system of contracts for actors , since Paramount had twenty - four stars signed at the time . * In 1951 , the logo was redesigned as a matte painting created by Jan Domela . * A newer , more realistic - looking logo debuted in 1953 for Paramount films made in 3D . It was reworked in early - to - mid 1954 for Paramount films made in widescreen process VistaVision . The text VistaVision \u2013 Motion Picture High Fidelity was often imposed over the Paramount logo briefly before dissolving into the title sequence . In early 1968 , the text \" A Paramount Picture / Release \" was shortened to \" Paramount \" , and the byline A Gulf+Western Company appeared on the bottom . The logo was given yet another modification in 1974 , with the number of stars being reduced to 22 , and the Paramount text and Gulf+Western byline appearing in different fonts . * In September 1975 , the logo was simplified in a shade of blue , adopting the modified design of the 1968 print logo , which was in use for many decades afterward .",

They purchased the Robert Brunton Studios , a 26 - acre facility at 5451 Marathon Street for US $ 1 million . In 1927 , Famous Players - Lasky took the name Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation . Three years later , because of the importance of the Publix Theatres , it became Paramount Publix Corporation . In 1928 , Paramount began releasing Inkwell Imps , animated cartoons produced by Max and Dave Fleischer ' s Fleischer Studios in New York City . The Fleischers , veterans in the animation industry , were among the few animation producers capable of challenging the prominence of Walt Disney . The Paramount newsreel series Paramount News ran from 1927 to 1957 . Paramount was also one of the first Hollywood studios to release what were known at that time as \" talkies \" , and in 1929 , released their first musical , Innocents of Paris . Richard A.

Balaban ( who would eventually supervise all stage production nationwide and produce talkie shorts ) , and their partner Sam Katz ( who would run the Paramount - Publix theatre chain in New York City from the thirty - five - story Paramount Theatre Building on Times Square ) . Balaban and Katz had developed the Wonder Theater concept , first publicized around 1918 in Chicago . The Chicago Theater was created as a very ornate theater and advertised as a \" wonder theater . \" When Publix acquired Balaban , they embarked on a project to expand the wonder theaters , and starting building in New York in 1927 . While Balaban and Public were dominant in Chicago , Loew ' s was the big player in New York , and did not want the Publix theaters to overshadow theirs . The two companies brokered a non - competition deal for New York and Chicago , and Loew ' s took over the New York area projects , developing five wonder theaters . Publix continued Balaban ' s wonder theater development in its home area . 1931 \u2013 1940 : Receivership",

Zukor ' s over - expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases led the company into receivership in 1933 . A bank - mandated reorganization team , led by John Hertz and Otto Kahn kept the company intact , and , miraculously , Zukor was kept on . In 1935 , Paramount - Publix went bankrupt . In 1936 , Barney Balaban became president , and Zukor was bumped up to chairman of the board . In this role , Zukor reorganized the company as Paramount Pictures , Inc. and was able to successfully bring the studio out of bankruptcy . As always , Paramount films continued to emphasize stars ; in the 1920s there were Swanson , Valentino , and Clara Bow . By the 1930s , talkies brought in a range of powerful new draws : Miriam Hopkins , Marlene Dietrich , Mae West , W.C. Fields , Jeanette MacDonald , Claudette Colbert , the Marx Brothers ( whose first two films were shot at Paramount ' s Astoria , New York , studio ) , Dorothy Lamour , Carole Lombard , Bing Crosby , band leader Shep Fields , famous Argentine tango singer Carlos Gardel , and Gary Cooper among them . In this period Paramount can truly be described as a movie factory , turning out sixty to seventy pictures a year . Such were the benefits of having a huge theater chain to fill , and of block booking to persuade other chains to go along . In 1933 , Mae West would also add greatly to Paramount ' s success with her suggestive movies She Done Him Wrong and I ' m No Angel . However , the sex appeal West gave in these movies would also lead to the enforcement of the Production Code , as the newly formed organization the Catholic Legion of Decency threatened a boycott if it was not enforced .",

Paramount Pictures Corporation was formed to be the production distribution company , with the 1,500 - screen theater chain handed to the new United Paramount Theaters on December 31 , 1949 . Leonard Goldenson , who had headed the chain since 1938 , remained as the new company ' s president . The Balaban and Katz theatre division was spun off with UPT ; its trademark eventually became the property of the Balaban and Katz Historical Foundation . The Foundation has recently acquired ownership of the Famous Players Trademark . Cash - rich and controlling prime downtown real estate , Goldenson began looking for investments . Barred from film - making by prior anti - trust rulings , he acquired the struggling ABC television network in February 1953 , leading it first to financial health , and eventually , in the mid - 1970s , to first place in the national Nielsen ratings , before selling out to Capital Cities in 1985 ( Capital Cities would eventually sell out , in turn , to The Walt Disney Company in 1996 ) . United Paramount Theaters was renamed ABC Theaters in 1965 and was sold to businessman Henry Plitt in 1974 . The movie theater chain was renamed Plitt Theaters . In 1985 , Cineplex Odeon Corporation merged with Plitt . In later years , Paramount ' s TV division would develop a strong relationship with ABC , providing many hit series to the network . The DuMont Network Paramount Pictures had been an early backer of television , launching experimental stations in 1939 in Los Angeles and Chicago . The Los Angeles station eventually became KTLA , the first commercial station on the West Coast . The Chicago station got a commercial license as WBKB in 1943 , but was sold to UPT along with Balaban & Katz in 1948 and was eventually resold to CBS as WBBM - TV . In 1938 , Paramount bought a stake in television manufacturer DuMont Laboratories . Through this stake , it became a minority owner of the DuMont Television Network . Also Paramount launched its own network , Paramount Television Network , in 1948 through its television unit , Television Productions , Inc .",

Scott , accompanied by Ernest Shackleton and Edward Wilson , set out with the aim of travelling as far south as possible , and on 31 December 1902 , reached 82 \u00b0 16\u2032 S.

Robert Falcon Scott returned to Antarctica with his second expedition , the Terra Nova Expedition , initially unaware of Amundsen ' s secretive expedition . Scott and four other men reached the South Pole on January 17 , 1912 , thirty - four days after Amundsen . On the return trip , Scott and his four companions all died of starvation and extreme cold . In 1914 Ernest Shackleton ' s Imperial Trans - Antarctic Expedition set out with the goal of crossing Antarctica via the South Pole , but his ship , the Endurance , was frozen in pack ice and sank 11 months later .

The US Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station was established by air over 1956 \u2013 1957 for the International Geophysical Year and has been continuously staffed since then by research and support personnel .

There have been many subsequent expeditions to arrive at the South Pole by surface transportation , including those by Havola , Crary and Fiennes . Subsequent to the establishment , in 1987 , of the logistic support base at Patriot Hills Base Camp , the South Pole became more accessible to non - government expeditions . On December 30 , 1989 , Arved Fuchs and Reinhold Messner were the first to traverse Antarctica via the South Pole without animal or motorized help , using only skis and the help of wind . The fastest unsupported journey to the Geographic South Pole from the ocean is 24 days and one hour from Hercules Inlet and was set in 2011 by Norwegian adventurer Christian Eide , who beat the previous solo record set in 2009 by American Todd Carmichael of 39 days and seven hours , and the previous group record also set in 2009 of 33 days and 23 hours . In the 2011 / 12 summer , separate expeditions by Norwegian Aleksander Gamme and Australians James Castrission and Justin Jones jointly claimed the first unsupported trek without dogs or kites from the Antarctic coast to the South Pole and back .

                    "context": "The South Pole , also known as the Geographic South Pole or Terrestrial South Pole , is one of the two points where the Earth ' s axis of rotation intersects its surface . It is the southernmost point on the surface of the Earth and lies on the opposite side of the Earth from the North Pole . Situated on the continent of Antarctica , it is the site of the United States Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station , which was established in 1956 and has been permanently staffed since that year . The Geographic South Pole should not be confused with the South Magnetic Pole , which is defined based on the Earth ' s magnetic field . Geography For most purposes , the Geographic South Pole is defined as the southern point of the two points where the Earth ' s axis of rotation intersects its surface ( the other being the Geographic North Pole ) . However , the Earth ' s axis of rotation is actually subject to very small \" wobbles \" ( polar motion ) , so this definition is not adequate for very precise work . The geographic coordinates of the South Pole are usually given simply as 90 \u00b0 S , since its longitude is geometrically undefined and irrelevant . When a longitude is desired , it may be given as At the South Pole , all directions face north . For this reason , directions at the Pole are given relative to \" grid north \" , which points northwards along the prime meridian . Along tight latitude circles , clockwise is east , and counterclockwise is west , opposite the way it is at the North Pole . The Geographic South Pole is located on the continent of Antarctica ( although this has not been the case for all of Earth ' s history because of continental drift ) . It sits atop a featureless , barren , windswept and icy plateau at an altitude of 2,835 metres ( 9,301 ft ) above sea level , and is located about 1,300 km ( 800 mi ) from the nearest open sea at Bay of Whales . The ice is estimated to be about 2,700 metres ( 9,000 ft ) thick at the Pole , so the land surface under the ice sheet is actually near sea level . The polar ice sheet is moving at a rate of roughly 10 metres per year in a direction between 37 \u00b0 and 40 \u00b0 west of grid north , down towards the Weddell Sea . Therefore , the position of the station and other artificial features relative to the geographic pole gradually shift over time .",

However , it is always low in the sky , reaching a maximum of 23.5 \u00b0 in December . Much of the sunlight that does reach the surface is reflected by the white snow . This lack of warmth from the sun , combined with the high altitude ( about 2800 m ) , means that the South Pole has one of the coldest climates on Earth ( though it is not quite the coldest ; that record goes to the region in the vicinity of the Vostok Station , also in Antarctica , which lies at a higher elevation ) . Temperatures at the South Pole are much lower than at the North Pole , primarily because the South Pole is located at altitude in the middle of a continental land mass , while the North Pole is at sea level in the middle of an ocean , which acts as a reservoir of heat .

Most recipients of Ridenhour ' s letter ignored it , with the exception of Congressman Mo Udall and Senators Barry Goldwater and Edward Brooke . Udall urged the House Armed Services Committee to call on Pentagon officials to conduct an investigation . Independent investigative journalist Seymour Hersh , after extensive interviews with Calley , broke the M\u1ef9 Lai story on November 12 , 1969 , on the Associated Press wire service ; on November 20 , Time , Life and Newsweek magazines all covered the story , and CBS televised an interview with Paul Meadlo , a soldier in Calley ' s unit during the massacre . The Plain Dealer ( Cleveland , Ohio ) published explicit photographs of dead villagers killed at M\u1ef9 Lai . As members of Congress called for an inquiry and news correspondents abroad expressed their horror at the massacre , the General Counsel of the Army Robert Jordan was tasked with speaking to the press . He refused to confirm allegations against Calley . Noting the significance of the fact that the statement was given at all , Bill Downs of ABC News said it amounted to the first public expression of concern by a \" high defense official \" that American troops \" might have committed genocide . \"",

He was asked whether the order included the killing of women and children . Those present later gave differing accounts of Medina ' s response . Some , including platoon leaders , testified that the orders as they understood them were to kill all guerrilla and North Vietnamese combatants and \" suspects \" ( including women and children , as well as all animals ) , to burn the village , and pollute the wells . He was also quoted as saying , \" They ' re all VC , now go and get them \" , and was heard to reply to the question \" Who is my enemy ? \" by saying , \" Anybody that was running from us , hiding from us , or appeared to be the enemy . If a man was running , shoot him , sometimes even if a woman with a rifle was running , shoot her . \" At Calley ' s trial , one defense witness testified that he remembered Medina instructing to destroy everything in the village that was \" walking , crawling or growing \" . Charlie Company was to enter the village of S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 spearheaded by its 1st Platoon , engage the enemy , and flush it out . The other two companies from TF Barker were ordered to secure the area and provide support if needed . The area was designated a free fire zone , where American forces were allowed to deploy artillery and air strikes in populated areas . Killings On the Saturday morning of March 16 at 07:30 , around 100 soldiers from the Charlie Company led by CPT Ernest Medina , following a short artillery and helicopter gunship barrage , landed in helicopters at S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 , a patchwork of settlements , rice paddies , irrigation ditches , dikes , and dirt roads , connecting an assortment of hamlets and sub - hamlets . The largest among them were the hamlets My Lai , Co Luy , My Khe , and Tu Cung . Though the GIs were not fired upon after landing , they still suspected there were Vietcong guerrillas hiding underground or in the huts . Confirming their suspicions , the gunships engaged several armed enemy in a vicinity of My Lai ; later , one weapon ( a carbine ) was retrieved from the site .",

Lacross and Captain Medina ' s command post remained outside . On approach , both platoons fired at people they saw in the rice fields and in the brush . The villagers , who were getting ready for a market day , at first did not panic or run away , and they were herded into the hamlet ' s commons . Harry Stanley , a machine gunner from the Charlie Company , said during the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division ' s ( CID ) inquiry that the killings started without warning . He first observed a member of the 1st Platoon strike a Vietnamese man with a bayonet . Then , the same trooper pushed another villager into a well and threw a grenade in the well . Further , he saw fifteen or twenty people , mainly women and children , kneeling around a temple with burning incense . They were praying and crying . They were all killed by shots in the head . Most of the killings occurred in the southern part of Tu Cung , a sub - hamlet of Xom Lang , which was a home to 700 residents . Xom Lang was erroneously marked on the U.S. military operational maps of Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province as My Lai . A large group of approximately 70 \u2013 80 villagers was rounded up by the 1st Platoon in Xom Lang , and then led to an irrigation ditch to the east of the settlement . All detainees were pushed into the ditch and then killed after repeated orders issued by Lieutenant Calley , who was also shooting . Paul Meadlo , a Private First Class ( PFC ) , testified that he expended several M16 magazines . He recollected that women were allegedly saying \" No VC \" and were trying to shield their children . He remembered that he was shooting into women with babies in their hands since he was convinced at that time that they were all booby - trapped with grenades and were poised to attack . On another occasion during the security sweep of My Lai , Meadlo again fired into civilians side - by - side with Lieutenant Calley .",

Thompson then saw a group of civilians ( again consisting of children , women , and old men ) at a bunker being approached by ground personnel . Thompson landed and told his crew that if the soldiers shot at the Vietnamese while he was trying to get them out of the bunker that they were to open fire on these soldiers . Thompson later testified that he spoke with a lieutenant ( identified as Stephen Brooks of the 2nd Platoon ) and told him there were women and children in the bunker , and asked if the lieutenant would help get them out . According to Thompson , \" he [ the lieutenant ] said the only way to get them out was with a hand grenade \" . Thompson testified that he then told Brooks to \" just hold your men right where they are , and I ' ll get the kids out \" . He found 12 \u2013 16 people in the bunker , coaxed them out and led them to the helicopter , standing with them while they were flown out in two groups . Returning to M\u1ef9 Lai , Thompson and other air crew members noticed several large groups of bodies . Spotting some survivors in the ditch , Thompson landed again . A crew member , Glenn Andreotta entered the ditch and returned with a bloodied , but apparently unharmed child who was flown to safety . The child was thought to be a boy , but later turned out to be a four - year - old girl . Thompson then reported what he had seen to his company commander , Major ( MAJ ) Frederic W. Watke , using terms such as \" murder \" and \" needless and unnecessary killings \" . Thompson ' s statements were confirmed by other helicopter pilots and air crew members . For the actions at My Lai , Thompson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) and his crew members Glenn Andreotta and Lawrence Colburn were awarded Bronze Star medals . Glenn Andreotta was awarded his medal posthumously , as he was killed in Vietnam on April 8 , 1968 . As the DFC citation included a fabricated account of rescuing a young girl from My Lai from \" intense crossfire \" Thompson threw his medal away .

Consequently , NBC aired on September 10 , 1969 a segment in the Huntley - Brinkley Report which mentioned the murder of a number of civilians in South Vietnam . Following that , emboldened Ronald Ridenhour decided to disobey the Army ' s order to withhold the information from the media . He approached reporter Ben Cole of the Phoenix Republic , who chose not to handle the scoop . Charles Black from the Columbus Enquirer uncovered the story on his own but also decided to put it on hold . Two major national news press outlets \u2013 The New York Times and The Washington Post , received some tips with partial information but did not act on them . A phone call on October 22 , 1969 , answered by freelance investigative journalist , Seymour Hersh , and his subsequent independent inquiry , broke the wall of silence that was surrounding the My Lai massacre . Hersh initially tried to sell the story to Life and Look magazines ; both turned it down . Hersh then went to the small Washington - based Dispatch News Service , which sent it to fifty major American newspapers ; thirty of them accepted it for publication . New York Times reporter Henry Kamm investigated further and found several My Lai massacre survivors in South Vietnam . He estimated the number of killed civilians as 567 . Next , Ben Cole published an article about Ronald Ridenhour , a helicopter gunner and an Army whistleblower , who was among the first started to uncover the truth about the My Lai massacre . Joseph Eszterhas of The Plain Dealer , who was a friend of Ronald Haeberle and knew about the photo evidence of the massacre , published the grisly images of the dead bodies of old men , women , and children on November 20 , 1969 . Time magazine ' s article on November 28 , 1969 and in Life magazine on December 5 , 1969 , finally brought My Lai to the fore of the public debate about Vietnam War . Richard L. Strout , the Christian Science Monitor political commentator , emphasized that , \" American press self - censorship thwarted Mr. Ridenhour ' s disclosures for a year . \" \" No one wanted to go into it \" , his agent said of telegrams sent to Life , Look , and Newsweek magazines outlining allegations .

The group ' s original lineup consisted of brothers Brian , Dennis , and Carl Wilson , their cousin Mike Love , and their friend Al Jardine . They emerged at the vanguard of the \" California Sound \" , initially performing original surf songs that gained international popularity for their distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing , cars , and romance . Rooted in jazz - based vocal groups , 1950s rock and roll , and doo - wop , Brian led the band in devising novel approaches to music production , arranging his compositions for studio orchestras , and experimenting with several genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and baroque . The group began as a garage band managed by the Wilsons ' father Murry , with Brian ' s creative ambitions and sophisticated songwriting abilities dominating the group ' s musical direction . After 1964 , their albums took a different stylistic path that featured more personal lyrics , multi - layered sounds , and recording experiments . In 1966 , the Pet Sounds album and \" Good Vibrations \" single vaulted the group to the top level of rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era . Following Smiles dissolution , Brian gradually ceded control to the rest of the band , reducing his input because of mental health and substance abuse issues . Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various music styles , the group ' s public image faltered , and they struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America . The continued success of their greatest hits albums during the mid 1970s precipitated the band ' s transition into an oldies act , a move that was denigrated by fans and critics . Since the 1980s , much - publicized legal wrangling over royalties , songwriting credits and use of the band ' s name transpired . Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998 . After Carl ' s death , many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and Bruce Johnston continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects . For the band ' s 50th anniversary , all the current surviving members briefly reunited for a new studio album and world tour . Even though Wilson and Jardine do not perform with Love and Johnston ' s band , they remain a part of the Beach Boys ' corporation , Brother Records Inc .",

But Russ Regan , a young promoter with Era Records \u2013 who later became president of 20th Century Fox Records \u2013 noted that there already existed a group by that name , and he suggested calling them the Beach Boys .

By the final weeks of 1961 \" Surfin ' \" had sold more than 40,000 copies . By this time , the de facto manager of the Beach Boys , Murry Wilson landed the group ' s first paying gig ( for which they earned $ 300 ) on New Year ' s Eve , 1961 , at the Ritchie Valens Memorial Dance in Long Beach , headlined by Ike & Tina Turner . In their earliest public appearances , the band wore heavy wool jacket - like shirts that local surfers favored before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants .

His enthusiasm interfered with his music studies at school . Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin Mike Love . Brian taught Love ' s sister Maureen and a friend harmonies . Later , Brian , Mike Love and two friends performed at Hawthorne High School . Brian also knew Al Jardine , a high school classmate who had already played guitar in a folk group called the Islanders . Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl . Love gave the fledgling band its name : \" The Pendletones \" , a portmanteau of \" Pendleton \" , a style of woolen shirt popular at the time and \" tone \" , the musical term . Though surfing motifs were prominent in their early songs , Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group . He suggested that the group compose songs that celebrated the sport and the lifestyle that it had inspired in Southern California . Jardine and a singer friend , Gary Winfrey , went to Brian to see if he could help out with a version of a folk song they wanted to record \u2013 \" Sloop John B \" . In Brian ' s absence , the two spoke with their father , a music industry veteran of modest success . Murry arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher , Hite Morgan . The group performed a slower ballad , \" Their Hearts Were Full of Spring \" , but failed to impress Morgan . After an awkward pause , Dennis mentioned they had an original song , \" Surfin ' \" . Brian finished the song , and together with Mike Love , wrote \" Surfin ' Safari \" .

The band recorded two more originals on April 19 at Western Studios , Los Angeles : \" Lonely Sea \" and \" 409 \" . They also re - recorded \" Surfin ' Safari \" . During early 1962 , Morgan requested that some of the members add vocals to a couple of instrumental tracks that he had recorded with other musicians . This led to the creation of the short - lived group Kenny & the Cadets , which Brian led under the pseudonym \" Kenny \" . The other members were Carl , Jardine , and the Wilsons ' mother Audree . On June 4 , the Beach Boys released their second single \" Surfin ' Safari \" backed with \" 409 \" . The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of Billboard . The magazine praised Love ' s lead vocal and said the song had strong hit potential . On July 16 , 1962 \u2013 after being turned down by Dot and Liberty \u2013 the Beach Boys signed a seven - year contract with Capitol Records , based on the strength of the June demo session . This was at the urging of Capitol exec Nick Venet who signed the group , seeing them as the \" teenage gold \" he had been scouting for . By November , their first album was ready \u2013 Surfin ' Safari , which reached 32 on the US Billboard charts . Their song output continued along the same commercial line , focusing on California youth lifestyle . In January 1963 , three months after the release of their debut album , the band began recording their sophomore effort , Surfin ' U.S.A. , a breakthrough for Brian , who began asserting himself as songwriter and arranger . The LP was the start of Brian ' s penchant for doubletracking vocals , a pioneering innovation . Released on March 25 , 1963 , Surfin ' U.S.A. , met a more enthusiastic reception , reaching number two on the Billboard charts . This propelled the band into a nationwide spotlight , and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze . Five days prior to the release of Surfin ' U.S.A. , Brian produced \" Surf City \" , a song he had written for Jan and Dean . \" Surf City \" hit number one on the Billboard charts in July 1963 , a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry , who felt his son had \" given away \" what should have been the Beach Boys ' first chart - topper .",

Two months later , the album that the song appeared on , All Summer Long , reached number four on the Billboard 200 charts . All Summer Long introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys ' sound exemplified by the piccolos and xylophones of its title track . The album was a swan - song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon . Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path . Before this , a live album , Beach Boys Concert , was released in October to a four - week chart stay at number one , containing a setlist of previously recorded hits and covers that they had not yet recorded . It was the first live album that ever topped pop music record charts . Today ! and Summer Days In June 1964 , Brian began recording the bulk of The Beach Boys ' Christmas Album with a forty - one - piece studio orchestra in collaboration with Four Freshmen arranger Dick Reynolds . Released in December , it was divided between five new , original Christmas - themed songs , and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs . It would be regarded as one of the finest holiday albums of the rock era . One single from the album , \" The Man with All the Toys \" , was released , peaking at number 6 on the US Billboard Christmas chart . On October 29 , the Beach Boys performed for The T.A.M.I . Show , a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of hit - making musicians for a one - off performance . The result was released to movie theaters one month later .",

For the recording of the Beach Boys ' instrumental tracks , Brian arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of session musicians informally known as the Wrecking Crew . Their assistance was needed because of the increasingly complicated nature of the material . As a result , a number of songs do not credit the Beach Boys as instrumentalists , but nearly invariably as lead , harmony , or backing vocalists . It ' s the belief of Richie Unterberger that , \" Before session musicians took over most of the parts , the Beach Boys could play respectably gutsy surf rock as a self - contained unit . \" Carl continued to play beside these musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions .

                    "context": "Family Feud is an American television game show created by Mark Goodson where two families compete to name the most popular responses to survey questions in order to win cash and prizes . The program premiered on ABC on July 12 , 1976 , and ran as part of its daytime schedule until June 14 , 1985 . The program was re - launched by CBS on July 4 , 1988 , and ran until September 10 , 1993 . Three separate editions for syndication were also produced . The first aired from September 19 , 1977 to September 6 , 1985 . The second aired from September 19 , 1988 to September 8 , 1995 . The current syndicated series premiered on September 20 , 1999 . The ABC network version of the show and the first syndicated series were hosted by Richard Dawson . Ray Combs hosted the CBS series and the first six seasons of the accompanying syndicated version , then was replaced by Dawson for the final season . The 1999 syndicated series has been hosted by Louie Anderson ( 1999 \u2013 2002 ) , Richard Karn ( 2002 \u2013 06 ) , John O ' Hurley ( 2006 \u2013 10 ) , and Steve Harvey ( 2010 \u2013 present ) . Announcers for the series have included Gene Wood ( 1976 \u2013 95 ) , Burton Richardson ( 1999 \u2013 2010 ) , Joey Fatone ( 2010 \u2013 15 ) , and Rubin Ervin ( 2015 \u2013 present ) . The program has spawned multiple regional adaptations in over 50 international markets outside the United States . Within a year of its debut , the original version became the number one game show in daytime television ; however , as viewing habits changed , the ratings declined . Harvey ' s takeover in 2010 increased Nielsen ratings significantly and eventually placed the program among the top five most popular syndicated television shows in the country . In 2013 , TV Guide ranked Family Feud third in its list of the 60 greatest game shows of all time . Gameplay Each episode of Family Feud features ten contestants from two different families competing to win cash and prizes , including a new car for those families who win five matches , with five members apiece representing each family . The original version of the show began with the families being introduced , seated opposite each other as if posing for family portraits , after which Dawson would interview them .",

Although the goal remained of giving only the number - one answer , the format was modified to three questions from five , with only one member of each family participating for all three questions . The initial stake for each family remained the same ( $ 2,500 in the first half of the hour and $ 5,000 in the second ) . However , the value for each question was $ 500 , $ 1,500 and $ 2,500 in the first half , with values doubling for the second half . This meant a potential maximum bank of $ 7,000 in the first half and $ 14,000 in the second . The Bullseye round temporarily returned during the 2009 \u2013 10 season . It was played similarly as the format used from 1992 to 1994 on the syndicated version , with five questions worth from $ 1,000 to $ 5,000 . However , each family was given a $ 15,000 starting stake , which meant a potential maximum of a $ 30,000 bank . Hosts and announcers The ABC and first syndicated versions of Family Feud were hosted by Richard Dawson . As writer David Marc put it , Dawson ' s on - air personality \" fell somewhere between the brainless sincerity of Wink Martindale and the raunchy cynicism of Chuck Barris \" . Dawson showed himself to have insistent affections for all of the female members of each family that competed on the show , regardless of age . Writers Tim Brooks , Jon Ellowitz , and Earle F. Marsh owed Family Feuds popularity to Dawson ' s \" glib familiarity \" ( he had previously played Newkirk on Hogan ' s Heroes ) and \" ready wit \" . The show ' s original announcer was Gene Wood , with Johnny Gilbert and Rod Roddy serving as occasional substitutes . In 1988 , Ray Combs took over Dawson ' s role as host on CBS and in syndication with Wood returning as announcer and Roddy , Art James , and Charlie O ' Donnell serving in that role when Wood was not available . Combs hosted the program until the daytime version ' s cancellation in 1993 and the syndicated version until the end of the 1993 \u2013 94 season . Dawson returned to the show at the request of Mark Goodson Productions for the 1994 \u2013 95 season .",

The second half featured former champion families who appeared on Family Feud between 1975 and 1985 , with the winner of the first half of the show playing one of these families in the second half . From 1999 to 2002 , two new families appeared on each episode . The returning champions rule was reinstated with the same five - day limit starting with the 2002 \u2013 03 season .

Bullseye game In June 1992 , the CBS daytime edition of Feud expanded from thirty to sixty minutes and became known as Family Feud Challenge . As part of the change , a new round was added at the start of each game called \" Bullseye \" . This round determined the potential Fast Money stake for each team . Each team was given a starting value for their bank and attempted to come up with the top answer to a survey question to add to it . The Bullseye round was added to the syndicated edition in September 1992 . The first two members of each family appeared at the face - off podium and were asked a question to which only the number - one answer was available . Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the family ' s bank . The process then repeated with the four remaining members from each family . On the first half of the daytime version , families were staked with $ 2,500 . The first question was worth $ 500 , with each succeeding question worth $ 500 more than the previous , with the final question worth $ 2,500 . This allowed for a potential maximum bank of $ 10,000 . For the second half of the daytime version , and also on the syndicated version , all values were doubled , making the maximum potential bank $ 20,000 . The team that eventually won the game played for their bank in Fast Money .",

For several seasons after the 1999 return to syndication , there was no specific point goal . Instead , four rounds were played , with the last for triple points and only one strike . The family with the most points after the fourth round won the game . Fast Money Two members of the winning family played Fast Money for a chance at a cash bonus . To start the round , one of the two players is asked a series of five survey questions in rapid fire fashion and had to answer them within a set time limit . The limit was originally fifteen seconds , but was extended in 1994 to twenty seconds . The clock does not start until after the first question is asked and passing on a question is allowed , with any passed questions revisited after all five were asked if time permitted . Once all five questions are answered , or if time expired before that , the first player is shown how many people in the survey , if any , had given his / her particular answers . After the total score from the five questions is tabulated , the board is cleared and the second player takes his / her turn . The same five questions are asked with the same rules , but the second player is not allowed to repeat an answer the first player gave ( indicated by a buzzer ) and is given twenty - five seconds ( originally twenty ) to complete the round . If , between the two of them , the players score at least 200 points , the family wins the bonus . If not , they are given five dollars per point scored as a consolation prize . The grand prize for winning Fast Money has varied . When the program aired in daytime , families played for $ 5,000 . The grand prize for syndicated episodes was $ 10,000 for much of its existence . In 2001 , the prize was doubled to $ 20,000 at the request of then - host Louie Anderson . Returning champions When Family Feud premiered on ABC , network rules dictated how much a family could win . Once any family reached $ 25,000 , they were retired as champions .

Like its predecessor , this version also had an accompanying syndicated edition which launched in September 1988 . In June 1992 , the network version expanded from its original half - hour format to a full hour , and was retitled The Family Feud Challenge ; this new format featured three families per episode , which included two new families competing in the first half - hour for the right to play the returning champions in the second half . The Family Feud Challenge aired its final new episode on March 26 , 1993 , with reruns airing until September 10 . The syndicated Feud , meanwhile , remained in production and entered its sixth season in the fall of 1993 . However , it found itself in the same ratings trouble and needed to make some changes to stave off cancellation itself . When this particular edition of Feud was in its developmental stages , Mark Goodson made it clear that he would not consider Dawson to host , having lingering bad feelings over repeated clashes Dawson had with the show ' s production staff . Goodson , however , had died in 1992 and his son , Jonathan Goodson , was now in control of the production company . Thus , he was tasked with finding a remedy to the ratings issues . Despite his father ' s loyalty to Combs , Jonathan Goodson was willing to consider to make any changes necessary to improve the ratings of the struggling Feud . After meeting with his staff , Goodson decided the best move for the company was to ask Dawson , who was retired from show business , to replace Combs as host , which he agreed to do . Combs finished out the remainder of the season but , upset by the decision to replace him , he departed from the studio as soon as the final episode of the year finished taping . A revamped Family Feud returned for a seventh season in September 1994 with Dawson in his role as host . The show expanded from thirty to sixty minutes , reinstated the Family Feud Challenge format , and did various other things to try to improve the ratings of the show such as build a more modern - looking set , feature families that had previously been champions on the original Feud , and have more themed weeks . Although Dawson did bring a brief ratings surge when he came back , the show could not sustain it long term and Feud came to a conclusion at the end of the 1994 \u2013 95 season . 1999 \u2013 present",

Giving an answer not on the board , or failing to respond within the allotted time , earns one strike . If the family earns three strikes , their opponents are given one chance to steal the points for the round by guessing any still - concealed answer ; failing to do so awards the points to the family that originally had control . Answers are worth one point for every person in the 100 - member survey who gave them . The winning family in each round scores the total points for all revealed answers to that question , including those given during the face - off but excluding the one used to steal ( if applicable ) . The number of answers on the board decreases from round to round , and certain rounds are played for double or triple value . The first family to score 300 points wins the game and advances to the Fast Money bonus round for a chance to win a cash bonus . Until 1992 , both teams received $ 1 per point scored . Prior to 1999 , the game continued as normal until one family reached the necessary total to win . Since then , if neither team reaches the goal after four rounds , one last question is played for triple value with only the # 1 answer displayed .",

The series chronicled the adventures of young Mark Wedloe ( played by Clint Howard ) and his lovable 650 - to - 750 - pound black bear named Ben . Gentle Ben was produced by Ivan Tors , who also produced the Gentle Giant pilot film . Tors was an established producer of successful TV series , including Lloyd Bridges ' Sea Hunt , Flipper and Daktari . Like the Gentle Giant film , the TV series Gentle Ben was set in Florida ( allowing Tors to use his own studio facilities there ) rather than Alaska , and Ben was a large black bear instead of the brown bear of the original novel . The TV series picked up the story where Gentle Giant left off , with Mark ' s father Tom Wedloe already a wildlife officer in the Everglades , and Ben an adult bear and established family pet living outside ( or sometimes inside ) the Wedloes ' house . Cast of the TV series The TV series had few regular characters , consisting of the Wedloe family and their friend and neighbor Henry Boomhauer . Clint Howard and Dennis Weaver continued their roles from the Gentle Giant film . The role of Ellen Wedloe , played in Gentle Giant by Vera Miles , was recast for the TV series with Beth Brickell , after Diana Muldaur turned down the part . The Boomhauer character appeared in nearly half the episodes and was played by Clint ' s real - life father Rance Howard ( who also wrote episodes for the show ) . Other recurring characters included Hank Minegar , a squatter played by Robertson White ( who had a different small role in Gentle Giant ) and Willie , a friend of Mark ' s , played by Angelo Rutherford . Although several black bears were used to play Ben , depending on what behavior was required for a particular scene , the role was played primarily by Bruno the Bear ( who also played adult Ben in the Gentle Giant film ) . Musician and voice actor Candy Candido provided the voice of Ben . Although the network wanted to have Ben speak like a human on the show , Tors disliked the idea , so Ben only made animal noises . Notable guest stars included Burt Reynolds , Jay Silverheels , Strother Martin , Slim Pickens , Victor French , and Clint Howard ' s brother Ron Howard . Bears in the TV series",

                    "context": "Producer Ivan Tors made the film Gentle Giant ( originally titled Gentle Ben ) for Paramount Pictures based on Morey ' s book , and partially funded by CBS . At that time , Tors was focusing on films and television shows involving animals and directed at a family audience . He had previously had popular hits with the 1963 film Flipper about a boy ' s friendship with a wild dolphin , which led to a television series of the same name , and with the 1965 film Clarence , the Cross - Eyed Lion , which led to the 1966 \u2013 1968 series Daktari about a veterinarian on a game preserve in Africa . Originally , Tors planned to release the Gentle Giant film ahead of the TV series , as he had done with Flipper and Clarence , the Cross - Eyed Lion . However , the release date for Gentle Giant was moved to be closer to Thanksgiving . As a result , by the time Gentle Giant was released , the Gentle Ben TV series based on the film had already been airing for six weeks . The film , which was a prequel to the TV series , served as promotion for the series already in progress . The film Gentle Giant and TV series Gentle Ben had the same main characters \u2013 Tom and Ellen Wedloe and their son Mark , who befriends Ben the bear \u2013 and two of the same lead actors , Dennis Weaver as Tom Wedloe and Clint Howard as Mark Wedloe . Bruno the Bear also appeared as \" Ben \" in both the film and TV series . The film was shot on location in the Florida Everglades and in the old fishing town of Port Salerno , Florida . Differences from the novel Although Gentle Giant follows the same basic storyline as Morey ' s novel , there are several differences between the book and the film : * The filmmakers changed the location from Alaska to the Florida Everglades , and changed Ben from a brown bear , a species not native to Florida , to a large American black bear , common in Florida . Tors had an active Florida - based film studio at the time . * The Andersens ' last name was changed to Wedloe , and the father ' s first name to Tom , rather than Karl . Fog Benson ' s last name was also changed to Hanson . * The character of Mark was made much younger in the film ; Clint Howard was 6 years old when he was cast . In the novel , Mark is a young teenager who is small for his age .",

The original novel told the story of the friendship between a large male bear named Ben and a boy named Mark . The story provided the basis for the 1967 film Gentle Giant ( 1967 ) , the popular late 1960s U.S. television series Gentle Ben , a 1980s animated cartoon and two early 2000s made - for - TV movies . 1965 children ' s novel Gentle Ben Walt Morey , a filbert farmer and former boxer , had previously written many pulp fiction stories for adults dealing with subjects such as boxing , the Old West , and outdoor adventures , published in magazines such as Argosy . However , due to the decline in demand for pulp fiction caused by the advent of broadcast television in the 1950s , Morey stopped writing for ten years . His wife , a schoolteacher , challenged him to write adventure stories that would interest young readers , similar to those of Jack London . After several years , Morey took up her challenge with the goal of producing an adventure story for young readers that adults could also enjoy . The result was Gentle Ben , which was based on Morey ' s own past experiences working and traveling in Alaska . Morey said that many of the book characters were based on real Alaskan people he had met . According to Morey , the concept of a boy ' s friendship with an Alaskan brown bear was also taken from real life , and such friendships and interactions between humans and bears were not unusual in Alaska . Originally published in 1965 by E.P . Dutton , the novel was a success , selling nearly 3 million copies and winning the Dutton Animal Book Award that year . Morey went on to write many more children ' s novels , often involving themes of nature , animals and survival , but is best known for Gentle Ben . Synopsis of the novel",

                    "context": "According to most sources , the primary bear trainers and bear handlers who did most of the day - to - day bear work on the series were head bear trainer Monty Cox ( who said that he was hired after \" Ben \" had \" chewed up \" a previous bear trainer ) , and Vern Debord . Other animal trainers involved in the series included Ron Oxley and Steve Martin . Derrick Rosaire Sr. and Pat Derby have also claimed involvement , although it is not clear whether they worked on the TV series or just on the Gentle Giant pilot film . Bruno and some of the other bears were trained using \" affection training \" , which stressed establishing a respectful bond between animal and trainer , rather than using punishment or food rewards . However , food rewards were used to motivate at least one bear who responded better to that method . Bruno reportedly lived with Cox in a Miami apartment , sometimes even following him into the shower and sleeping in his bed . During and after the run of the TV series , the name \" Ben \" or \" Gentle Ben \" was used to refer to a number of bears who had appeared in the show . Bruno ' s name was changed to \" Ben \" while he was appearing in the series ; it was changed back to \" Bruno \" after the show ended . Oxley and Martin made personal appearances at fairs and events with a bear ( often Drum ) billed as \" Gentle Ben . \" In the late 1960s and 1970s , Rosaire Sr. appeared with the Emmett Kelly Circus and elsewhere with a trained bear he called \" Gentle Ben \" that purportedly played the role . Rosaire Sr. , his son and grandson have said over the years that this bear was a female bear who played both Ben ' s mother and Ben in the Gentle Giant film . ( Ben ' s mother never appears in the TV series as she is killed at the beginning of the film , and the TV series takes place after the events of the film . ) Tuffy Truesdell also trained a wrestling brown bear known as \" Gentleman Ben \" and occasionally called \" Gentle Ben \" or \" Ben \" , who wrestled in at least 80 matches for various promotions in the late 1960s and 1970s . Although Truesdell claimed that his bears did work on the TV series , there is no evidence linking the particular bear he called \" Gentleman Ben \" to the TV show , particularly since the show used black bears rather than brown bears .",

                    "context": "In the series , Tom Wedloe often traveled the Everglades via airboat and Jeep , while Henry Boomhauer drove a swamp buggy . The airboat , with the characters of Tom , Mark and Ben the bear riding it , was prominently featured in the show ' s opening credits . Dennis Weaver later recounted an incident where one of the bear actors , Hammer , capsized the airboat . According to trainer Monty Cox , Ivan Tors once expressed concern that when Bruno the bear walked away from the camera , his testicles were visible in some shots , and asked if Cox could somehow tape them up so they would be out of camera view . Cox refused . Several people involved with the series , including Cox , have confirmed that the bears used in the production were sometimes ill - tempered or did not behave as expected , and that working with them could be dangerous . On one occasion , Bruno the bear sat on Clint Howard . According to Dennis Weaver , during the run of the show , the cast and crew were forbidden to publicly mention any incidents of bear misbehavior . However , Clint Howard has stated that he never suffered any injuries from the bears on the show , and that his only injury came from working with a raccoon that had not been declawed . Reception Gentle Ben was a moderate hit , reaching a position of # 19 in the Nielsen ratings during its first season . A number of TV tie - in products were marketed , including children ' s books ( by authors other than Walt Morey ) , a board game and a pull - string talking \" Gentle Ben \" plush bear by Mattel , a lunchbox , and an album of songs sung by the cast members entitled The Stars of \" Gentle Ben \" : The Bear Facts . Dell Comics produced a Gentle Ben comic book , featuring photo covers of the TV show actors , that ran for five issues in 1968 . However , in its second season , Gentle Ben failed to make the top 30 and was cancelled . Its decline in popularity has been attributed to its young target audience growing older and losing interest in animal shows , and also to its timeslot forcing it to compete with Walt Disney ' s Wonderful World of Color for its target audience . A letter - writing campaign to save the show ( even read into the Congressional Record ) resulted in 2600 letters being sent to the network , but was not successful .",

                    "context": "Till Death Us Do Part is a British television sitcom that aired on BBC1 from 1965 to 1975 . First airing as a Comedy Playhouse pilot , the show aired in seven series until 1975 . Six years later , ITV continued the sitcom , calling it Till Death ... . From 1985 to 1992 , the BBC produced a sequel In Sickness and in Health . Created by Johnny Speight , Till Death Us Do Part centred on the East End Garnett family , led by patriarch Alf Garnett ( Warren Mitchell ) , a reactionary white working - class man who holds racist and anti - socialist views . His long - suffering wife Else was played by Dandy Nichols , and his daughter Rita by Una Stubbs . Rita ' s husband Mike Rawlins ( Anthony Booth ) is a socialist layabout . The character Alf Garnett became a well known character in British culture , and Mitchell played him on stage and television up until Speight ' s death in 1998 . In addition to the spin - off In Sickness and in Health , Till Death Us Do Part was re - made in many countries including Brazil , Germany ( Ein Herz und eine Seele ) , the Netherlands ( In Voor - En Tegenspoed ) , and is known to the United States as the show that inspired All in the Family . Many episodes from the first three series are thought to no longer exist , having been wiped in the late 1960s and early ' 70s as was the policy at the time . Series Success years The series became an instant hit because , although a comedy , in the context of its time it did deal with aspects of working class life comparatively realistically . It addressed racial and political issues at a difficult time in British society . The attitude of those who made the programme was that Alf ' s views were so clearly unacceptable that they were risible , but someconsidered the series uncomfortable and disturbing . Some were oblivious to the fact that Johnny Speight was satirising racist attitudes . Ironically , many who held similar opinions to the character enjoyed the show , perhaps missing the point that Alf ' s opinions were considered offensive and that they were being ridiculed . Mitchell imbued the character of Alf Garnett with an earthy charm that served to humanise Alf and make him likable . According to interviews he gave , the fact that some viewers overlooked Alf ' s views and regarded him as a rough diamond disappointed Speight .",

The problem was solved by having her pre - record her lines which were then edited into the show . Eventually even this was too much and so in a later episode Else was seen leaving for Australia , to Alf ' s dismay . Patricia Hayes , who had been seen from time to time previously as next door neighbour Mrs. Reed , was given a first name Min and became a starring character along with her husband Bert , previously played by Bill Maynard and now by Alfie Bass . The show ' s rating began to suffer and in 1975 , the series was dropped . The final episode saw Alf lose his job and receive a telegram from Else asking for a divorce . Production As with most BBC sitcoms Till Death Us Do Part was recorded before a live studio audience . The programmes were recorded onto 2 inch Quadruplex videotape . From 1966 to 1968 the show was transmitted in black and white . When the series returned in 1972 , it was transmitted in colour . The opening titles / end credits of the first colour episodes originally used the b / w sequence from the ' 60s tinted in red , as seen on UKTV Gold repeats in 2006 . The house seen in the opening and closing titles to the 1960s episodes was located on Garnet Street in Wapping ( from where writer Johnny Speight took the Garnett family name ) and this terrace was demolished in the 1980s . A terrace of newer multicoloured homes and an estate agents take their place . They are located on Garnet street in close proximity to the local Wallace James shop , St Peter ' s Primary School , Gastronomica bar , Docklands General Store and Crane Wharf .

Film adaptations Two feature films were made based on the series - the first was Till Death Us Do Part ( 1969 ) , whose first half dealt with the younger Alf and Else during World War II , and whose second half dealt with all the Garnetts in the present day being moved from their East End slum to the new town of Hemel Hempstead , and the adjustments and changes that brought on the family . It gave a nuanced glimpse of British life at the time . The second film , The Alf Garnett Saga ( 1972 ) had Adrienne Posta playing the part of Rita and Paul Angelis playing Mike . It is notable for featuring Alf Garnett on an LSD trip . DVD In the UK , Network released the first two colour series on DVD ( Series 4 and 5 ) but these releases are no longer being printed - the license has expired and rights have reverted to BBC Worldwide , who release their titles through 2 Entertain .

Alf ' s rejoinder is \" She ' s concerned for the bleedin ' moral fibre of the nation ! \" The episode ends with the book being burnt . Ultimately \" silly moo \" became a comic catchphrase . Another Garnett phrase was \" it stands to reason \" , usually before making some patently unreasonable comment . Alf was an admirer of Enoch Powell , a right - wing Conservative politician known particularly for strong opposition to the immigration of non - white races into the United Kingdom . Alf was also a supporter of West Ham United ( a football club based in the East End ) and known to make derogatory remarks about \" the Jews up at Spurs \" ( referring to Tottenham Hotspur , a north London club with a sizeable Jewish following ) . This was a playful touch by Speight , knowing that in real life Mitchell was both Jewish and a Spurs supporter . In interviews , Speight explained he had originally based Alf on his father , an East End docker who was staunchly reactionary and held \" unenlightened \" attitudes toward black people . Speight made clear that he regretted his father held such attitudes - beliefs Speight regarded as reprehensible . Speight saw the show as a way of ridiculing such views and dealing with his complex feelings about his father . The series switched to colour when it returned in 1972 and Rita had a baby son , Michael . Decline",

                    "context": "The show captured a key feature of Britain in the 1960s - the widening generation gap . Alf ( and to a lesser degree his wife ) represented the old guard , the traditional and conservative attitudes of the older generation . Alf ' s battles with his left - wing son - in - law were not just ideological but generational and cultural . His son - in - law and daughter represented the younger generation . They supported the aspects of the new era such as relaxed sexual mores , fashions , music , etc . The same things were anathema to Alf - and indicative of everything that was wrong with the younger generation and the liberal attitudes they embraced . Alf was portrayed as the archetypal working - class Conservative . The subjects that excited him most were football and politics , though his actual knowledge of either was limited . He used language not considered acceptable for television in the 1960s . He often referred to racial minorities as \" coons \" and similar terms . He referred to his Liverpudlian son - in - law as \" Shirley Temple \" or a \" randy Scouse git \" ( Randy Scouse Git , as a phrase , caught the ear of Micky Dolenz of The Monkees who heard it while on tour in the UK and used it as the title of the group ' s following single - though their record label renamed it ' Alternate Title ' in the UK market to avoid controversy ) , and to his wife as a \" silly [ old ] moo \" ( a substitute for ' cow ' which was vetoed by the BBC ' s head of comedy Frank Muir ) . However , Michael Palin writes in his diary 16 July 1976 that Warren Mitchell told him that \" silly moo \" was n ' t scripted , \" It came out during a rehearsal when he forgot the line \" Silly old mare \" . \" Controversially , the show was one of the earliest mainstream programmes to feature the swear word ' bloody ' . The show was one of many held up by Mary Whitehouse as an example of the BBC ' s moral laxity.See for example her responses to an episode referred to as \" Bird Fancier \" ( first transmitted on 20 September 1972 ) , which features a discussion of the Virgin birth of Jesus , as detailed in Michael Tracey and David Morrison Whitehouse , London & Basingstoke : Macmillan , 1979 , p.110 - 16 . The episode is also known as \" Pigeon Fancier \" , but the recording as broadcast contains no identifying caption .",

The series had Alf and Else sharing a bungalow with Min ( Patricia Hayes ) following the death of her husband Bert ( Alfie Bass ) in Eastbourne . Although Rita remained in the cast , Anthony Booth declined to return . Rita ' s son Michael was now a teenager and a punk rocker ( even though he was born in 1972 and therefore should only have been about 9 or 10 ) . The series was not a success and when Central Television were awarded the contract for the Midlands region from 1982 , it was decided that Till Death ... was not to return . In 1985 Alf Garnett returned to the BBC for In Sickness and in Health . This took Alf and Else ( who was now in a wheelchair ) onward into old age , and some of Alf ' s more extreme opinions were found to have mellowed . Una Stubbs made some guest appearances but Anthony Booth apparently was n ' t interested in reprising his role . Eventually Mike and Rita divorced and Rita began dating a doctor . After the first series Dandy Nichols died , and so subsequent episodes showed Alf having to deal with the greatest loss of his life , Else , whom he truly loved . The loss of Else and Rita as regulars in the cast meant that new characters had to be brought in as antagonists for Alf . These notably included his home help , Winston ( played by Eamonn Walker ) , who was both black and gay , and Alf ' s prim upstairs neighbour , Mrs Hollingberry ( played by Carmel McSharry ) , who eventually agreed to marry Alf . In 1988 , Speight was warned about the use of racist language - and after discussion it was decided that Garnett ' s offensive language was to be discontinued and the character of Winston was to be written out . With such characters helping update the basic concept , the \" Sickness and Health \" series ran until 1992 . Warren Mitchell also appeared solo on stage and TV as Alf Garnett , dispensing variations on Alf ' s homespun reactionary philosophy and singing old music hall songs . Most notable was the LWT show An Audience With Alf Garnett - which allowed Garnett to return to his racialist attitude . Another show was called It Stands To Reason - The Thoughts Of Chairman Alf ; one reviewer concluded that \" Speight and Mitchell are to be congratulated for understanding so well the mind of a man who they hate \" .

Stephen Armstrong worked as an auditor for the Ohio state government ; the family moved around the state repeatedly after Armstrong ' s birth , living in 20 towns . Neil ' s love for flying grew during this time , having gotten off to an early start when his father took his two - year - old son to the Cleveland Air Races . When he was five , he experienced his first airplane flight in Warren , Ohio on July 20 , 1936 when he and his father took a ride in a Ford Trimotor , also known as the \" Tin Goose \" . His father ' s last move was in 1944 , back to Neil ' s birthplace , Wapakoneta , in Auglaize County . Armstrong attended Blume High School and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield . He earned a student flight certificate on his 16th birthday , then soloed later in August ; all before he had a driver ' s license . Armstrong was active in the Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout . As an adult , he was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award . On July 18 , 1969 , while flying towards the Moon inside the Columbia , Armstrong greeted the Scouts : \" I ' d like to say hello to all my fellow Scouts and Scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week ; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes \" . Houston replied : \" Thank you , Apollo 11 . I ' m sure that , if they did n ' t hear that , they ' ll get the word through the news . Certainly appreciate that . \" Among the very few personal items that Neil Armstrong carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge . In 1947 , at age 17 , Armstrong began studying aeronautical engineering at Purdue University . He was the second person in his family to attend college . He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . The only engineer he knew ( who had attended MIT ) dissuaded him from attending , telling Armstrong that it was not necessary to go all the way to Cambridge , Massachusetts , for a good education .",

In June , he made his first jet carrier landing on and was promoted the same week from Midshipman to Ensign . By the end of the month , Essex had set sail with VF - 51 aboard , bound for Korea , where its VF - 51 would act as ground - attack aircraft .",

Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside , Eagle was depressurized , the hatch was opened and Armstrong made his way down the ladder first . At the bottom of the ladder Armstrong said , \" I ' m going to step off the LEM now \" ( referring to the Apollo Lunar Module ) . He then turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 2:56 UTC July 21 , 1969 , then spoke the famous words , \" That ' s one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind . \" Armstrong prepared his famous epigram on his own . In a post - flight press conference , he said that he decided on the words \" just prior to leaving the LM [ lunar module ] . \" In a 1983 interview in Esquire Magazine , Armstrong explained to George Plimpton : \" I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth , but I thought the chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money \u2013 fifty \u2013 fifty ... Most people do n ' t realize how difficult the mission was . So it did n ' t seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we ' d have to abort landing . \" In 2012 , brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil had shown him a note with a draft of the line months before the launch , although historian Andrew Chaikin , who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon , disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission . Recordings of Armstrong ' s transmission do not evidence the indefinite article \" a \" before \" man \" , though NASA and Armstrong insisted for years that static had obscured it . Armstrong stated he would never make such a mistake , but after repeated listenings to recordings , he eventually admitted he must have dropped the \" a \" . He later said he \" would hope that history would grant me leeway for dropping the syllable and understand that it was certainly intended , even if it was not said \u2013 although it might actually have been \" .",

In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong ' s biography in 2005 , Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Armstrong as commander , lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin and command module pilot Michael Collins , he was offering the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell . After thinking it over for a day , Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin , as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command . Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the Lunar Module Pilot , unofficially the lowest ranked member , and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell , the commander of Gemini 12 , in the number 3 position of the crew . A March 1969 meeting between Slayton , George Low , Bob Gilruth , and Chris Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon , in some part because NASA management saw Armstrong as a person who did not have a large ego . A press conference held on April 14 , 1969 , gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong ' s being first ; the hatch opened inwards and to the right , making it difficult for the lunar module pilot , on the right - hand side , to exit first . Slayton added , \" Secondly , just on a pure protocol basis , I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out ... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that . Bob Gilruth approved my decision . \" At the time of their meeting , the four men did not know about the hatch consideration . The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his 2001 autobiography . On July 16 , 1969 , Armstrong received a crescent Moon carved out of Styrofoam from the pad leader , Guenter Wendt , who described it as a key to the Moon . In return , Armstrong gave Wendt a ticket for a \" space taxi \" \" good between two planets \" . Voyage to the Moon",

According to the couple , there was no real courtship , and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement , except that it occurred while Armstrong was working at the NACA ' s Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory . They were married on January 28 , 1956 , at the Congregational Church in Wilmette , Illinois . When he moved to Edwards Air Force Base , he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base , while Janet lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles . After one semester , they moved into a house in Antelope Valley . Janet never finished her degree , a fact she regretted later in life . The couple had three children together : Eric , Karen , and Mark . In June 1961 , daughter Karen was diagnosed with a malignant tumor of the middle part of her brain stem ; X - ray treatment slowed its growth , but her health deteriorated to the point where she could no longer walk or talk . Two - year - old Karen died of pneumonia , related to her weakened health , on January 28 , 1962 . Armstrong later completed his Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southern California in 1970 . He would eventually be awarded honorary doctorates by several universities . Test pilot Following his graduation from Purdue , Armstrong decided to become an experimental research test pilot . He applied at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) High - Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base , which was later redesignated as the \u2018 \u2018 NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center \u2019 \u2019 in 2014 . Although the committee had no open positions , it forwarded his application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland , where Armstrong began working in March 1955 . Armstrong ' s stint at Cleveland lasted a couple of months , and by July 1955 he had returned to Edwards AFB for a new job . On his first day at Edwards , Armstrong was tasked his first assignments , which were to pilot chase planes during releases of experimental aircraft from modified bombers . He also flew the modified bombers , and on one of these missions had his first flight incident at Edwards . On March 22 , 1956 , Armstrong was in a Boeing B - 29 Superfortress , which was to air - drop a Douglas D - 558 - 2 Skyrocket . He sat in the right - hand pilot seat while the left - hand seat commander , Stan Butchart , flew the B - 29 .",

Ford and James R. Hansen , Armstrong ' s authorized biographer , presented these findings to Armstrong and NASA representatives , who conducted their own analysis . Armstrong found Ford ' s analysis \" persuasive . \" However , the article by Ford was published on Ford ' s own web site rather than in a peer - reviewed scientific journal , and linguists David Beaver and Mark Liberman wrote of their skepticism of Ford ' s claims on the blog Language Log . Thus , NASA ' s transcript continues to show the \" a \" in parentheses . When Armstrong made his proclamation , Voice of America was rebroadcast live via the BBC and many other stations worldwide . The estimated global audience at that moment was 450 million listeners , out of a then estimated world population of 3.631 billion people . About 20 minutes after the first step , Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface and became the second human to set foot on the Moon , and the duo began their tasks of investigating how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface . Early on , they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight , and also planted the flag of the United States . The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole . Since the rod did not fully extend , and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey , the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance , as if there were a breeze . Shortly after their flag planting , President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office . The President spoke for about a minute , after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds . In the entire Apollo 11 photographic record , there are only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected . The mission was planned to the minute , with the majority of photographic tasks to be performed by Armstrong with a single Hasselblad camera .",

Five days later on September 3 , he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon - ni , west of Wonsan . While making a low bombing run at about 350 mph , Armstrong ' s F9F Panther was hit by anti - aircraft fire . While trying to regain control , he collided with a pole at a height of about 20 ft , which sliced off about three feet ( 1 m ) of the Panther ' s right wing . Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory , but due to the loss of the aileron , ejection was his only safe option . He planned to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters , and therefore flew to an airfield near Pohang , but his ejection seat was blown back over land . A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked Armstrong up ; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of No . 125122 F9F - 2 . Armstrong flew 78 missions over Korea for a total of 121 hours in the air , most of which were in January 1952 . He received the Air Medal for 20 combat missions , a Gold Star for the next 20 , and the Korean Service Medal and Engagement Star . Armstrong left the Navy at age 22 on August 23 , 1952 , and became a lieutenant ( junior grade ) , in the U.S . Naval Reserve . He remained in the reserve for eight years , then resigned his commission on October 21 , 1960 . College years After his service with the Navy , Armstrong returned to Purdue , where his best grades came in the four semesters following his return from Korea . He had previously earned average marks , but his final GPA was 4.8 out of 6.0 . He pledged the Phi Delta Theta fraternity after his return and he wrote and co - directed its musical as part of the all - student revue ; he was also a member of Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity and a baritone player in the Purdue All - American Marching Band .

Bandar Seri Begawan has an estimated population of 50,000 , and including the whole Brunei - Muara District , the metro area has an estimated population of 279,924 . Etymology The original name for this city was \" Bandar Brunei \" or \" Brunei Town \" in English . In 1967 , Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III abdicated in favour of his eldest son , Hassanal Bolkiah and took the title of \" Seri Begawan \" . Bolkiah was then made as a defence minister and on 5 October 1970 , he renamed the city to honour his late father . The word \" Begawan \" was also used for Bruneian monarchs who have abdicated , the word originally coming from the Sanskrit word for \" god \" : \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d bhagav\u0101n . Besides that , Seri Begawan was known as \" blessed one \" in Sanskrit . Seri comes from the honorific Sanskrit word \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 Sri , and Bandar comes from Persian via Indian languages and originally meant \" harbour \" or \" port \" or \" haven \" .

The first settlement on the banks of the Brunei River can be traced back to the 8th century where there had been settlements similar to those in Kampong Ayer , located near the present site of the Brunei Museum with the modern city on the opposite shore . During the Bruneian Empire period from 15th \u2013 17th century , the Sultanate ruled much part of Borneo including the southern part of the Philippines and its capital of Manila , with the water settlement near the city area became the third centre of the administration after been moved twice from Kota Batu and Kampong Ayer . When the Sultanate rule declined through the eighteenth century due to the arrival of western powers such as the Spanish , Dutch and the British , this settlement population was totally decreased from its peak of 20,000 inhabitants . From 1888 until its independence in 1984 , Brunei was a British protectorate and land development began in 1906 when the British resident encouraged the Sultanate citizens to moved on a reclaimed land on the western bank of the inlet . In 1899 , first oil well was drilled at Ayer Bekunchi near Kampung Kasat , Bandar Seri Begawan . Although the oil well was drilled as deep as 259 metres ( 850 feet ) , no oil was found in the well . Oil exploration in Brunei later shifted to Seria and Belait District in 1924 . Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam II established a new palace on the west bank in 1909 after been persuaded by the British , along with the arriving of Chinese traders to boost the economy . Mosque and government buildings was also built along the western shores in 1920 . In the same year , the new settlement was declared as a new capital of Brunei and became a municipal area .",

His diverse body of work , spanning six decades , covers numerous genres and subjects throughout the Americas , Europe , and Africa . Early modernist work Strand was born in New York City to Bohemian parents . In his late teens , he was a student of renowned documentary photographer Lewis Hine at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School . It was while on a fieldtrip in this class that Strand first visited the 291 art gallery \u2013 operated by Stieglitz and Edward Steichen \u2013 where exhibitions of work by forward - thinking modernist photographers and painters would move Strand to take his photographic hobby more seriously . Stieglitz would later promote Strand ' s work in the 291 gallery itself , in his photography publication Camera Work , and in his artwork in the Hieninglatzing studio . Some of this early work , like the well - known \" Wall Street , \" experimented with formal abstractions ( influencing , among others , Edward Hopper and his idiosyncratic urban vision ) . Other of Strand ' s works reflect his interest in using the camera as a tool for social reform . He was one of the founders of the Photo League , an association of photographers who advocated using their art to promote social and political causes . Film - making Over the next few decades , Strand worked in motion pictures as well as still photography . His first film was Manhatta ( 1921 ) , also known as New York the Magnificent , a silent film showing the day - to - day life of New York City made with painter / photographer Charles Sheeler . Manhatta includes a shot similar to Strand ' s famous Wall Street ( 1915 ) photograph . In 1932 \u2013 35 , he lived in Mexico and worked on Redes ( 1936 ) , a film commissioned by the Mexican government , released in the US as The Wave . Other films he was involved with were the documentary The Plow That Broke the Plains ( 1936 ) and the pro - union , anti - fascist Native Land ( 1942 ) . France In June 1949 , Strand left the United States to present Native Land at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia . The remaining 27 years of his life were spent in Orgeval , France , where , despite never learning the language , he maintained an impressive , creative life , assisted by his third wife , fellow photographer Hazel Kingsbury Strand .",

After divorcing Salsbury , Strand married Virginia Stevens in 1935 . They divorced in 1949 ; he then married Hazel Kingsbury in 1951 and they remained married until his death in 1976 . Politics The timing of Strand \u2019 s departure to France is coincident with the first libel trial of his friend Alger Hiss , with whom he maintained a correspondence until his death . Although he was never officially a member of the Communist Party , many of Strand \u2019 s collaborators were either Party members ( James Aldridge ; Cesare Zavattini ) or were prominent socialist writers and activists ( Basil Davidson ) . Many of his friends were also Communists or were suspected of being so ( Member of Parliament D. N. Pritt ; film director Joseph Losey ; Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid ; actor Alex McCrindle ) . Strand was also closely involved with Frontier Films , one of more than 20 organizations that were identified as \" subversive \" and \" un - American \" by the US Attorney General . Strand also insisted that his books should be printed in Leipzig , East Germany , even if this meant that they were initially prohibited from the American market on account of their Communist provenance .

Though expected to be a big hit , the film fell short at the box office , despite gaining a cult following . His career improved with his role in The Name of the Rose ( 1986 ) alongside Sean Connery . Slater played Connery ' s apprentice monk while they investigated a series of murders at a Benedictine abbey . Slater followed this by playing Junior Tucker in Francis Ford Coppola ' s Tucker : The Man and His Dream ( 1988 ) , Gleaming the Cube ( 1989 ) and Beyond the Stars ( 1989 ) . Slater ' s career rose to new heights when he played the dark character J.D . in the 1989 film Heathers alongside Winona Ryder . Heathers was billed as the teen film of the late 1980s . Slater beat out many other actors such as Brad Pitt for the part and his performance drew comparison with a young Jack Nicholson . After Heathers and a small role in Stanley Kubrick ' s Full Metal Jacket ( 1987 ) , Slater had offers to play more troubled youths , including as a rebellious teen in Pump Up the Volume ( 1990 ) and a wild gunman in Young Guns II ( 1990 ) , in which Slater acted alongside Emilio Estevez and Kiefer Sutherland . Box office success In 1991 , Slater was cast as Will Scarlett in the Hollywood big budget production of Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves alongside Kevin Costner , Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman . The film was a commercial success , taking US $ 390 million worldwide , and Slater became one of the major A - list stars of the 1990s . With Slater being a big Star Trek fan , he accepted a minor role in Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country , shortly after playing Charlie Luciano in the crime drama Mobsters . The following year he starred in Kuffs . In 1993 , Slater tried to expand his film genre , playing opposite Marisa Tomei in Untamed Heart and playing Clarence Worley in the Quentin Tarantino - penned cult classic True Romance , which received many rave reviews . In his review of True Romance Roger Ebert awarded the movie 3 stars out of 4 and commented , ' the energy and style of the movie are exhilarating .

The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the Australian Open in mid January , the French Open in May and June , Wimbledon in June and July , and the US Open in August and September . Each tournament is played over a period of two weeks . The Australian and United States tournaments are played on hard courts , the French on clay , and Wimbledon on grass . Wimbledon is the oldest , founded in 1877 , followed by the US in 1881 , the French in 1891 , and the Australian in 1905 . However , of these four , only Wimbledon was a major before 1924 / 25 , the time when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments . The term Grand Slam also , and originally , refers to the achievement of winning all four major championships in a single calendar year within one of the five events : men ' s and women ' s singles ; men ' s , women ' s , and mixed doubles . In doubles , one team may accomplish a Grand Slam playing together or one player may achieve it with different partners . The term \" Grand Slam \" without qualification refers to winning the four majors in a single calendar year . Winning the four majors in consecutive tournaments but not in the same year is known as a Non - Calendar Year Grand Slam , while winning all four majors at any point during the course of a career is known as a Career Grand Slam . Winning the gold medal at the Summer Olympic Games in addition to the four majors in a one calendar year is known as a \" Golden Grand Slam \" or more commonly the \" Golden Slam \" . Also , winning the Year - End Championship ( known as ATP World Tour Finals for men ' s singles and doubles disciplines , and WTA Tour Championships for both women ' s disciplines ) in the same period is known as a \" Super Slam \" . Together , all four Majors in all three disciplines ( singles , doubles , and mixed doubles ) are called a \" boxed set \" of Grand Slam titles . No male or female player has won all twelve events in one calendar year , although a \" career boxed set \" has been achieved by three female players . Origin of the term \" Grand Slam \"",

However , Connors played in other tournaments and won the 1973 US Pro Singles , his first significant title , toppling Arthur Ashe in a five - set final , 6 \u2013 3 , 4 \u2013 6 , 6 \u2013 4 , 3 \u2013 6 , 6 \u2013 2 .

Grand slam for all of the tricks , in contrast to small slam or little slam for all but one , dates from early in the 19th century . This use was inherited by contract bridge , a modern development of whist defined in 1925 that became very popular in Britain and America by 1930 . Grand slam has been used in golf since 1930 , when Bobby Jones won the four major championships , two British and two American . Although John F. Kieran is widely credited with first applying the term \" grand slam \" to tennis , to describe the winning of all four major tennis tournaments in a calendar year , sports columnist Alan Gould had used the term in that connection almost two months before Kieran . History The possibility of being the reigning champion of all the current four Majors did not exist until 1924 / 25 , when the International Lawn Tennis Federation designated the Australasian , French ( before 1925 only open to members of French tennis clubs ) , British and American championship tournaments as the four Majors . Before that time only three events : Wimbledon , the World Hard Court Championships ( held in Paris & once in Brussels ) and the World Covered Court Championships ( held in various locations ) were considered the premier international tennis events by the ILTF . Tony Wilding of New Zealand won all three of those earlier majors in one year \u2013 1913 . It has been possible to complete a Grand Slam in most years and most disciplines since 1925 . It was not possible from 1940 to 1945 because of interruptions at Wimbledon , the Australian and French opens due to the Second World War , the years from 1970 to 1985 when there was no Australian tournament in mixed doubles , and 1986 when there was no Australian Open at all . The first definitive Grand Slam , of the current four majors , was accomplished when Don Budge won all four men ' s singles Majors in 1938 . To date , 17 players have completed a Grand Slam , though only six in the most prestigious singles titles . Of these players , three have won multiple Grand Slams : Rod Laver accomplished the feat twice in men ' s singles ; Margaret Court accomplished the feat three times , in two different disciplines \u2013 once in women ' s singles and twice in mixed doubles ; and Esther Vergeer completed a grand slam twice in Women ' s wheelchair doubles .",

In his 1979 autobiography , Jack Kramer , the long - time tennis promoter and great player himself , ranked Connors as one of the 21 best players of all time . Connors won more matches ( 1,337 ) than any other male professional tennis player in the open era . His career win - loss record was 1,337 \u2013 285 for a winning percentage of 82.4 . He played 401 tournaments and through many years it was a record until Fabrice Santoro overcame it in 2008 . Connors was the only player to win the US Open on three different surfaces : grass , clay , and hard . He was also the first male tennis player to win Grand Slam singles titles on three different surfaces : grass ( 1974 ) , clay ( 1976 ) , and hard ( 1978 ) . In Grand Slam Singles events , Connors reached the semifinals or better a total of 31 times and the quarterfinals or better a total of 41 times . These achievements are particularly remarkable considering that he entered the Australian Open Men ' s Singles only twice and did not enter the French Open Men ' s Singles for five of his peak career years . The 31 semifinals stood as a record until surpassed by Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2012 . The 41 quarterfinals remained an all - time record until Roger Federer surpassed it at Wimbledon 2014 . Connors was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1998 and Intercollegiate Tennis Association ( ITA ) Hall of Fame in 1986 . He also has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame .

                    "context": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ) . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent ' s court . The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as \" lawn tennis \" . It had close connections both to various field ( \" lawn \" ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport of real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term \" tennis \" referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis : for example , in Disraeli ' s novel Sybil ( 1845 ) , Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will \" go down to Hampton Court and play tennis . \" The rules of tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point . Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport . The four Grand Slam tournaments ( also referred to as the \" Majors \" ) are especially popular : the Australian Open played on hard courts , the French Open played on red clay courts , Wimbledon played on grass courts , and the US Open played also on hard courts .

                    "context": "Connors was taught to hit the ball on the rise by his teaching - pro mother , Gloria Connors , a technique he used to defeat the opposition in the early years of his career . Gloria sent her son to Southern California to work with Pancho Segura at the age of 16 . Segura advanced Connors ' game of hitting the ball on the rise which enabled Connors to reflect the power and velocity of his opponents back at them . Segura was the master strategist in developing Jimmy ' s complete game . In the 1975 Wimbledon final , Arthur Ashe countered this strategy by taking the pace off the ball , giving Connors only soft junk shots ( dinks , drop shots , and lobs ) to hit . In an era when the serve and volley was the norm , Bj\u00f6rn Borg excepted , Connors was one of the few players to hit the ball flat , low , and predominantly from the baseline . Connors hit his forehand with a continental grip and with little net clearance . Some considered his forehand to be his greatest weakness , especially on extreme pressure points , as it lacked the safety margin of hard forehands hit with topspin . His serve , while accurate and capable , was never a great weapon for him as it did not reach the velocity and power of his opponents . His lack of a dominating serve and net game , combined with his individualist style and maverick tendencies , meant that he was not as successful in doubles as he was in singles , although he did win Grand Slam titles with Ilie N\u0103stase , reached a final with Chris Evert , and accumulated 15 doubles titles during his career . Racket evolution At a time when most other tennis pros played with wooden rackets , Connors pioneered the \" Wilson T2000 \" steel racket , which utilized a method for stringing that had been devised and patented by Lacoste in 1953 . He played with this chrome tubular steel racket until 1984 , when most other pros had shifted to new racket technologies , materials , and designs . At the Tokyo Indoor in October 1983 Connors switched to a new mid - size graphite racket , the Wilson ProStaff , that had been designed especially for him and he used it on the 1984 tour . But 1985 again found Connors playing with the T2000 . In 1987 he finally switched to a graphite racket when he signed a contract with Slazenger to play their Panther Pro Ceramic . In 1990 Connors signed with Estusa . Connors used lead tape which he would wind around the racket head to provide the proper \" feel \" for his style of game . Commentating",

It declared its secession from the Union on January 19 , 1861 , and was one of the original seven Confederate states . It was the last state to be restored to the Union , on July 15 , 1870 . Georgia is the 24th largest and the 8th most populous of the 50 United States . From 2007 to 2008 , 14 of Georgia ' s counties ranked among the nation ' s 100 fastest - growing , second only to Texas . Georgia is known as the Peach State and the Empire State of the South . Atlanta is the state ' s capital and its most populous city . Georgia is bordered on the south by Florida , on the east by the Atlantic Ocean and South Carolina , on the west by Alabama , and on the north by Tennessee and North Carolina . The northern part of the state is in the Blue Ridge Mountains , part of the Appalachian Mountains system . The Piedmont extends through the central part of the state from the foothills of the Blue Ridge to the Fall Line , where the rivers cascade down in elevation to the coastal plain of the southern part of the state . The highest point in Georgia is Brasstown Bald at 4784 ft above sea level ; the lowest point is the Atlantic Ocean . Georgia is the largest state east of the Mississippi River in land area . History Before settlement by Europeans , Georgia was inhabited by the mound building cultures . The British colony of Georgia was founded by James Oglethorpe on February 12 , 1733 . The colony was administered by the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America under a charter issued by ( and named for ) King George II . The Trustees implemented an elaborate plan for the colony ' s settlement , known as the Oglethorpe Plan , which envisioned an agrarian society of yeoman farmers and prohibited slavery . In 1742 the colony was invaded by the Spanish during the War of Jenkins ' Ear . In 1752 , after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony , the Trustees turned over control to the crown . Georgia became a crown colony , with a governor appointed by the king .",

He was born in rural Narrows , Georgia . Cobb spent 22 seasons with the Detroit Tigers , the last six as the team ' s player - manager , and finished his career with the Philadelphia Athletics . In 1936 Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame ballot , receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes ( 98.2 % ) ; no other player received a higher percentage of votes until 1992 . In 1999 , editors at the Sporting News ranked Ty Cobb 3rd on their list of \" Baseball ' s 100 Greatest Players \" . Cobb is widely credited with setting 90 MLB records during his career . He still holds several records as of the end of the 2014 season , including the highest career batting average ( .366 or .367 , depending on source ) and most career batting titles with 11 ( or 12 , depending on source ) .

He still holds the career record for stealing home ( 54 times ) and for stealing second base , third base , and home in succession ( 5 times ) , and as the youngest player ever to compile 4,000 hits and score 2,000 runs . Cobb ranks fifth all - time in number of games played and committed 271 errors , the most by any American League ( AL ) outfielder . Cobb ' s legacy as an athlete has sometimes been overshadowed by his surly temperament and aggressive playing style , which was described by the Detroit Free Press as \" daring to the point of dementia . \" Cobb himself wrote shortly before his death , \" In legend I am a sadistic , slashing , swashbuckling despot who waged war in the guise of sport . \" Cobb was notorious for sliding into bases feet first , with his spikes high .",

Georgia was the 10th state to ratify the Articles of Confederation on July 24 , 1778 , and was the 4th state to ratify the current Constitution on January 2 , 1788 . In 1829 , gold was discovered in the North Georgia mountains , which led to the Georgia Gold Rush and an established federal mint in Dahlonega , which continued its operation until 1861 . The subsequent influx of white settlers put pressure on the government to take land from the Cherokee Nation . In 1830 , President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act into law , sending many eastern Native American nations to reservations in present - day Oklahoma , including all of Georgia ' s tribes . Despite the Supreme Court ' s ruling in Worcester v. Georgia that states were not permitted to redraw the Indian boundaries , President Jackson and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling . In 1838 , his successor , Martin Van Buren , dispatched federal troops to gather the Cherokee and deport them west of the Mississippi . This forced relocation , known as the Trail of Tears , led to the death of over 4,000 Cherokees . In early 1861 , Georgia joined the Confederacy and became a major theater of the Civil War . Major battles took place at Chickamauga , Kennesaw Mountain , and Atlanta . In December 1864 , a large swath of the state from Atlanta to Savannah was destroyed during General William Tecumseh Sherman ' s March to the Sea . 18,253 Georgian soldiers died in service , roughly 1 of every 5 who served . In 1870 , following reconstruction , Georgia became the last Confederate state restored to the Union . With white Democrats having regained power in the state legislature , they passed a poll tax in 1877 , which disenfranchised many poor blacks and whites , preventing them from registering . In 1908 , the state established a white primary ; with the only competitive contests within the Democratic Party , it was another way to exclude blacks from politics . They constituted 46.7 % of the state ' s population in 1900 , but the proportion of Georgia ' s population that was African American dropped thereafter to 28 % primarily due to leaving the state during the Great Migration . This disfranchisement persisted through the mid - 1960s , until federal legislation with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . Geography Boundaries",

By most accounts , he became fascinated with baseball as a child , and decided he wanted to play professional ball one day ; his father was vehemently opposed to this idea , but by his teen years , he was trying out for area teams . He played his first years in organized baseball for the Royston Rompers , the semi - pro Royston Reds , and the Augusta Tourists of the South Atlantic League who released him after only two days.Stump ( 1994 ) , page 57 He then tried out for the Anniston Steelers of the semipro Tennessee \u2013 Alabama League , with his father ' s stern admonition ringing in his ears : \" Do n ' t come home a failure ! \" Stump ( 1994 ) , p. 63 After joining the Steelers for a monthly salary of $ 50 , Stump ( 1994 ) , p. 64 Cobb promoted himself by sending several postcards written about his talents under different aliases to Grantland Rice , the sports editor of the Atlanta Journal . Eventually , Rice wrote a small note in the Journal that a \" young fellow named Cobb seems to be showing an unusual lot of talent . \" Cobb & Stump , page 48 After about three months , Cobb returned to the Tourists and finished the season hitting .237 in 35 games.Stump ( 1994 ) , p. 69 In August 1905 , the management of the Tourists sold Cobb to the American League ' s Detroit Tigers for US $ 750 ( equivalent to approximately $ in today ' s funds ) .",

Georgia ' s native trees include red cedar , a variety of pines , oaks , hollies , cypress , sweetgum , scaly - bark and white hickories and sabal palmetto . East Georgia is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and conifer species as other broadleaf evergreen flora make up the majority of the southern and coastal regions . Yellow jasmine , and mountain laurel make up just a few of the flowering shrubs in the state . Fauna White - tailed ( Virginia ) deer are in nearly all counties . The northern mockingbird and brown thrasher are among the 160 bird species that live in the state . Reptiles and amphibians include the eastern diamondback , copperhead , and cottonmouth , salamanders , frogs , alligators and toads . There are about 79 species of reptile and 63 amphibians known to live in Georgia . The most popular freshwater game fish are trout , bream , bass , and catfish , all but the last of which are produced in state hatcheries for restocking . Popular saltwater game fish include red drum , spotted seatrout , flounder , and tarpon . Porpoises , whales , shrimp , oysters , and blue crabs are found inshore and offshore of the Georgia coast . Climate The majority of the state is primarily a humid subtropical climate . Hot and humid summers are typical , except at the highest elevations . The entire state , including the North Georgia mountains , receives moderate to heavy precipitation , which varies from 45 inches ( 1143 mm ) in central Georgia to approximately 75 inches ( 1905 mm ) around the northeast part of the state . The degree to which the weather of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on the latitude , its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico , and the elevation . The latter factor is felt chiefly in the mountainous areas of the northern part of the state , which are farther away from the ocean and can be 4500 feet ( 1350 m ) above sea level . The USDA Plant hardiness zones for Georgia range from zone 6b ( no colder than ) in the Blue Ridge Mountains to zone 8b ( no colder than 15 F ) along the Atlantic coast and Florida border .",

It then continues up the Tugaloo ( originally Tugalo ) and into the Chattooga River , its most significant tributary . These bounds were decided in the 1797 Treaty of Beaufort , and tested in the U.S. Supreme Court in the two Georgia v. South Carolina cases in 1923 and 1989 . The border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of Rabun County , at latitude 35 \u00b0 N , though from this point it diverges slightly south ( due to inaccuracies in the original survey ) . This was originally the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way back to the Mississippi River , until Tennessee was divided from North Carolina , and the Yazoo companies induced the legislature of Georgia to pass an act , approved by the governor in 1795 , to sell the greater part of Georgia ' s territory presently comprising Alabama and Mississippi . The state ' s western border then departs in another straight line south - southeastward , at a point southwest of Chattanooga , to meet the westernmost point of the Chattahoochee River near West Point . It continues down to the point where it ends at the Flint River ( the confluence of the two forming Florida ' s Apalachicola River ) , and goes almost due east and very slightly south , in a straight line to the origin of the St. Mary ' s River , which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean . The water boundaries are still set to be the original thalweg of the rivers . Since then , several have been inundated by lakes created by dams , including the Apalachicola / Chattahoochee / Flint point now under Lake Seminole . Georgia state legislators have claimed that in an 1818 survey , the state ' s border with Tennessee was erroneously placed one mile ( 1.6 km ) farther south than intended , and they proposed a correction in 2010 . The state was then in the midst of a significant drought , and the new border would allow Georgia access to water from the Tennessee River . Geology and terrain Each region has its own distinctive characteristics . For instance , the Ridge and Valley , which lies in the northwest corner of the state , includes limestone , sandstone , shale and other sedimentary rocks , which have yielded construction - grade limestone , barite , ocher , and small amounts of coal .

The festival is remembered for the first major American appearances by The Jimi Hendrix Experience , The Who and Ravi Shankar , the first large - scale public performance of Janis Joplin and the introduction of Otis Redding . The Monterey Pop Festival embodied the theme of California as a focal point for the counterculture and is generally regarded as one of the beginnings of the \" Summer of Love \" in 1967 ; the first rock festival had been held just one week earlier at Mount Tamalpais in Marin County , the KFRC Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival . Because Monterey was widely promoted and heavily attended , featured historic performances , and was the subject of a popular theatrical documentary film , it became an inspiration and a template for future music festivals , including the Woodstock Festival two years later . The festival The festival was planned in seven weeks by John Phillips of The Mamas & the Papas , record producer Lou Adler , Alan Pariser and publicist Derek Taylor . The Monterey location had been known as the site for the long - running Monterey Jazz Festival and Monterey Folk Festival ; the promoters saw the Monterey Pop festival as a way to validate rock music as an art form in the way in which jazz and folk were regarded . The organizers succeeded beyond all expectations . The artists performed for free with all revenue donated to charity , except for Ravi Shankar , who was paid $ 3,000 for his afternoon - long performance on the sitar . Country Joe and the Fish were paid $ 5,000 not by the festival itself , but from revenue generated from the D.A . Pennebaker documentary . Lou Adler later reflected :",

We did n ' t want people who got themselves into trouble and needed medical attention to go untreated . Nor did we want their problems to ruin or in any way disturb other people or disrupt the music\u2026 Our security worked with the Monterey police . The local law enforcement authorities never expected to like the people they came in contact with as much as they did . They never expected the spirit of ' Music , Love and Flowers ' to take over to the point where they ' d allow themselves to be festooned with flowers . Monterey ' s bill boasted a lineup that put established stars like The Mamas and the Papas , Simon & Garfunkel and The Byrds alongside groundbreaking new acts from the UK and the USA . Performances Jefferson Airplane With two huge singles behind them , Jefferson Airplane was one of the major attractions of the festival . The Who Although already a big act in the UK , and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier , The Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey . The band used rented Vox amps for their set , which were not as powerful as their regular Sound City amps which they had left in England to save shipping costs . At the end of their frenetic performance of \" My Generation \" , the audience was stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend smashed his guitar , smoke bombs exploded behind the amps and frightened concert staff rushed onstage to retrieve expensive microphones . At the end of the mayhem , drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage . The Who , after winning a coin toss , performed before Jimi Hendrix , as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other , both having planned instrument - demolishing conclusions to their respective sets . The Grateful Dead \" The Grateful Dead were beautiful . They did at top volume what Shankar had done softly . They played pure music , some of the best music of the concert . I have never heard anything in music that could be said to be qualitatively better than the performance of The Dead , Sunday night . \" - Michael Lydon , author of Flashbacks ( 2003 )",

Until that point , Redding had performed mainly for black audiences , besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go . Redding ' s show , received well by the audience ( \" there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding ' s set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend \" ) included \" Respect \" and a version of \" Satisfaction \" . The festival would be one of his last major performances . He died six months later in a plane crash at the age of 26 . Ravi Shankar Ravi Shankar was another artist who was introduced to America at the Monterey festival . The Raga Dhun ( Dadra and Fast Teental ) ( which was later miscredited as \" Raga Bhimpalasi \" ) , an excerpt from Shankar ' s four - hour performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival , concluded the Monterey Pop film , introducing the artist to a new generation of music fans . The Mamas & the Papas The Mamas & the Papas closed the festival . They also brought on Scott McKenzie to play his John Phillips - written single \" San Francisco , ( Be Sure To Wear Flowers In Your Hair ) \" . Their set included their biggest hits , \" Monday , Monday \" and \" California Dreamin ' \" . Cancellations and no - shows Several acts were also notable for their non - appearance . The Beach Boys , who had been involved in the conception of the event and were at one point scheduled to headline and close the show , failed to perform . This resulted from a number of issues plaguing the group . Carl Wilson was in a feud with officials for his refusal to be drafted into military service during the Vietnam War . The group ' s new , radical album Smile had recently been aborted , with band leader Brian Wilson in a depressed state and unwilling to perform ( he had n ' t performed live with the group since late 1964 , although he would do so in Honolulu , Hawaii in August 1967 ) . Since Smile had not been released , the group felt their older material would not go over well . The cancellation permanently damaged their reputation and popularity in the US , which would contribute to their replacement album Smiley Smile charting lower than any other of their previous album releases .",

However , group members Micky Dolenz ( in full American Indian buckskins and headdress ) and Peter Tork attended the festival and mingled with musicians backstage . Tork was asked to introduce Buffalo Springfield , his favorite group , for their set . Tork also introduced Lou Rawls and was involved in a bizarre incident where he walked out onstage in the middle of the Grateful Dead ' s set to try to stop fans from climbing on stage and dancing . Tork also informed the crowd that The Beatles were not at the festival in disguise . According to Eric Clapton , Cream did not perform because the band ' s manager wanted to make a bigger splash for their American debut . However , it has since been revealed that the band were not considered by the festival organizers . Influence Music writer Rusty DeSoto argues that pop music history tends to downplay the importance of Monterey in favor of the \" bigger , higher - profile , more decadent \" Woodstock Festival , held two years later . But , as he notes : \u2026Monterey Pop was a seminal event ... featuring debut performances of bands that would shape the history of rock and affect popular culture from that day forward . The County Fairgrounds in Monterey , California \u2026 had been home to folk , jazz and blues festivals for many years . But the weekend of June 16 \u2013 18 , 1967 was the first time it was used to showcase rock music .

The sound is projected either acoustically or through electrical amplification ( for an acoustic guitar or an electric guitar , respectively ) . It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the right hand while fretting ( or pressing against the frets ) the strings with the fingers of the left hand . The guitar is a type of chordophone , traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut , nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning . The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern , the vihuela , the four - course Renaissance guitar , and the five - course baroque guitar , all of which contributed to the development of the modern six - string instrument . There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar : the classical guitar ( nylon - string guitar ) , the steel - string acoustic guitar , and the archtop guitar . The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings ' vibration , amplified by the body of the guitar , which acts as a resonating chamber . The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger - picking technique . The term \" finger - picking \" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk , blues , bluegrass , and country guitar playing in the United States . Electric guitars , introduced in the 1930s , use an amplifier that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone . Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body , but a solid body was eventually found more suitable , as it was less prone to feedback . Electric guitars have had a continuing profound influence on popular culture . The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide . It is recognized as a primary instrument in genres such as blues , bluegrass , country , flamenco , folk , jazz , jota , mariachi , metal , punk , reggae , rock , soul , and many forms of pop .

Beaver and Krause had bought one of Moog ' s first synthesizers in 1966 and had spent a fruitless year trying to get someone in Hollywood interested in using it . Through their demonstration booth at Monterey , they gained the interest of acts including The Doors , The Byrds , The Rolling Stones , Simon & Garfunkel , and others . This quickly built into a steady stream of business , and the eccentric Beaver was soon one of the busiest session men in L.A . He and Krause earned a contract with Warner Brothers . Eric Burdon and the Animals later that same year , in their hit \" Monterey \" , quoted a line from the Byrds ' song \" Renaissance Fair \" ( \" I think that maybe I ' m dreamin ' \" ) and mentioned performers the Byrds , Jefferson Airplane , Ravi Shankar , Jimi Hendrix , The Who , Hugh Masekela , Grateful Dead , and the Rolling Stones ' Brian Jones ( \" His Majesty Prince Jones smiled as he moved among the crowd \" ) . The instruments used in the song imitate the styles of these performers . Recording and filming the festival The festival was the subject of a documentary movie entitled Monterey Pop , by noted documentary filmmaker D.A . Pennebaker . Pennebaker ' s team used recently developed portable 16mm crystal - sync motion picture cameras that stayed synchronized with double - system sound - recording systems . The film stock was Eastman Kodak ' s recently released \" high - speed \" 16mm Ektachrome 100 ASA color reversal motion picture stock , without which the nighttime shows would have been virtually impossible to shoot in color . Sound was captured by Wally Heider ' s mobile studio on a then state - of - the art eight - channel recorder , with one track used for the crystal - sync tone , to synchronize it with the film cameras . The Grateful Dead believed that the film was too commercial and refused permission to be shown . The screening of the film in theaters nationwide helped raise the festival to mythic status , rapidly swelled the ranks of would - be festival - goers looking for the next festival , and inspired new entrepreneurs to stage more such festivals around the country . An expanded version of the documentary has been released on DVD by the Criterion Collection .",

It has been described as \" an exercise in soul , psychedelic rock , and polyrhythmic jazz - inspired drumming \" by AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald . The song was remixed in stereo for the American release of the album . In 1969 , it was released as a stereo single in the UK with the title \" Let Me Light Your Fire \" . One of Hendrix ' s most popular songs , he frequently played it in concert . Several live recordings have been released and the original song is included on numerous Hendrix compilations , such as Smash Hits , Experience Hendrix : The Best of Jimi Hendrix , Voodoo Child : The Jimi Hendrix Collection , and Fire : The Jimi Hendrix Collection . Overview Despite its sexual overtones , the song had an innocuous origin . Noel Redding , bass player for the Experience , invited Hendrix to his mother ' s house on a cold New Year ' s Eve in Folkestone , England , after a gig . Hendrix asked Noel ' s mother if he could stand next to her fireplace to warm himself . She agreed , but her Great Dane was in the way , so Hendrix let out with , \" Aw , move over , Rover , and let Jimi take over \" . Hendrix later joked with the lyric : \" Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard to find her poor dog a bone , but when she bent over Rover took over , ' cause Rover had a bone of his own ! Shakespeare , page 35 ! \" The Red Hot Chili Peppers covered it on their 1989 album , Mother ' s Milk , changing some of the lyrics such as \" Move over , Rover , and let Jimi take over \" to \" Move over , Rover , and let Mr. Huckleberry take over \" as a tribute to the late RHCP guitarist , Hillel Slovak ( who was also known by his nickname , \" Mr. Huckleberry \" ) , who had died months before recording for the Mother ' s Milk album began . Kingston Wall covered it on their 1992 debut album I .

                    "context": "Della Street is the fictional secretary of Perry Mason in the long - running series of novels , short stories , films , and radio and television programs featuring the fictional defense attorney created by Erle Stanley Gardner . Description In the first Perry Mason novel , The Case of the Velvet Claws , written in the early days of the Great Depression , it is revealed that Della Street came from a wealthy , or at least well - to - do , family that was wiped out by the stock market crash of 1929 . Della was forced to get a job as a secretary . By the time of the TV series in the 1950s and 1960s , this would have not fit well with the age of the characters as then portrayed . According to The Case of The Caretaker ' s Cat , she is approximately 15 years younger than Perry Mason . A character named Della Street first appeared in Gardner ' s unpublished novel Reasonable Doubt , where she was a secretary , but not the secretary of the lawyer , Ed Stark . Gardner described her this way : \" Della Street \u2026 Secretary , twenty - seven , quiet , fast as hell on her feet , had been places . Worked in a carnival or side show , knows all the lines , hard - boiled exterior , quietly efficient , puzzled over the lawyer , chestnut hair , trim figure , some lines on her face , a hint of weariness at the corners of her eyes . \" When Gardner submitted Reasonable Doubt to William Morrow , an editor suggested that \" Della Street is a better character than the secretary . \" Gardner took this suggestion when he rewrote Reasonable Doubt as The Case of the Velvet Claws and made Della Street Perry Mason ' s secretary . In the published novel , the carnival or side show was jettisoned , and Street came from a more respectable background . This is a good example of the difference between the pulp writing and slick writing of the 1930s . In 1950 Gardner published the short story \" The Case of the Suspect Sweethearts \" under the pseudonym Della Street . There are several instances of sexual tension between Mason and Street in the Gardner novels ; multiple glances , kisses and so on . There were also several proposals of marriage , all of which Della turned down because she wanted to be a part of Mason ' s life and she knew that meant being a part of his work . In the case of the Weary Watchdog Della is pulled over and introduces herself to the officer as \" Mrs. BRANDON Street , Della Street . \" Adaptations",

Business career Fortune magazine listed Combs at number twelve on their top 40 of entrepreneurs under 40 in 2002 . Forbes Magazine estimates that for the year ending May 2012 , Combs earned $ 45 million , ranking him fifteenth among musicians . In 2015 his estimated net worth was $ 735 million . Sean John In 1998 , Combs started a clothing line , Sean John . It was nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America ( CFDA ) award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000 , and won in 2004 . The clothing line became the subject of controversy in 2003 , when the National Labor Committee revealed that factories producing the clothing in Honduras were violating Honduran labor laws . Among the accusations were that workers were subjected to body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests . Bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled . Employees were forced to work overtime and were paid sweatshop wages . Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee told The New York Times that \" Sean Puff Daddy obviously has a lot of clout , he can literally do a lot overnight to help these workers . \" Combs responded with an extensive investigation , telling reporters \" I ' m as pro - worker as they get \" . On February 14 , 2004 , Kernaghan announced that improvements had been implemented at the factory , including adding air conditioning and water purification systems , firing the most abusive supervisors , and allowing the formation of a labor union . In late 2006 , the department store Macy ' s removed Sean John jackets from their shelves when they discovered that the clothing was made using dog fur ( from a species called raccoon dog ) . Combs had not known the jackets were made with dog fur , but as soon as he was alerted , he had production stopped .",

As part of the Commonwealth Trans - Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958 . He subsequently reached the North Pole , making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest . Following his ascent of Everest , Hillary devoted most of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust , which he founded .

At 16 his interest in climbing was sparked during a school trip to Mount Ruapehu .

With his brother Rex , Hillary became a beekeeper , a summer occupation that allowed him to pursue climbing in the winter . He joined the Radiant Living Tramping Club , where a holistic health philosophy developed by the health advocate Herbert Sutcliffe was taught . Hillary developed his love for the outdoors on tours with the club through the Waitakere Ranges . His interest in beekeeping later led Hillary to commission Michael Ayrton to cast a golden sculpture in the shape of honeycomb in imitation of Daedalus ' s lost - wax process . This was placed in his New Zealand garden , where his bees took it over as a hive and \" filled it with honey and their young \" . World War II Upon the outbreak of World War II Hillary applied to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force ( RNZAF ) , but withdrew the application before it was considered because he was \" harassed by [ his ] religious conscience \" . In 1943 the Japanese threat in the Pacific and the arrival of conscription finally undermined his pacifist inclination and Hillary joined the RNZAF as a navigator serving in No . 6 Squadron RNZAF and then No . 5 Squadron RNZAF on Catalina flying boats .

The shield was contested for the first time on 29 November 2008 at Twickenham Stadium , and was presented to the winning team , the New Zealand national rugby union team , by Lady Hillary . Also on 23 October 2008 the Duke of Edinburgh ' s Award in New Zealand ( formerly the Young New Zealanders ' Challenge ) was announced as the youth programme that would take Sir Edmund ' s name as part of its brand ( at the request of the NZ Govt and the Hillary family ) . The organisation re - branded on 20 August 2009 as \" The Duke of Edinburgh ' s Hillary Award \" . On 11 January 2009 at 9 am the New Zealand duo , \" The Kiwis \" , performed their tribute song \" Hillary 88 \" in front of the Beehive in Wellington . This has been recorded as the official world memorial song for Sir Edmund Hillary with the endorsement of Lady Hillary . The band members were Dean Ward and George Watson of Levin . A four - day track in the Waitakere Ranges , along Auckland ' s west coast , is named the Hillary Trail , in honour of Sir Edmund . Hillary ' s father - in - law , Jim Rose , who had built a bach at Anawhata in 1925 , wrote \" My family look forward to the time when we will be able to walk from Huia to Muriwai on public walking tracks like the old - time Maori could do \" in his 1982 history of Anawhata Beach . Hillary loved the area , and had his own bach near Anawhata ( see Personal life , above ) . He and his friend , former mayor Bob Harvey , kept Rose ' s dream alive , and the track was eventually opened on 11 January 2010 , the second anniversary of Hillary ' s death . Rose Track , descending from Anawhata Road to Whites Beach , is named after the Rose family . The South Ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook , New Zealand ' s highest mountain , was renamed Hillary Ridge on 18 August 2011 . Hillary and three other climbers were the first party to successfully climb the ridge in 1948 . In September 2013 the Government of Nepal proposed naming a 7681 m mountain in Nepal Hillary Peak in his honour . After the New Horizons mission discovered a mountain range on Pluto on 14 July 2015 , it was informally named Hillary Montes ( Hillary Mountains ) by NASA . Legacy",

The Reserve Bank governor at the time , Don Brash , had originally intended to use a deceased sportsperson on the $ 5 note but could not find a suitable candidate . Instead he broke with convention by requesting and receiving Hillary ' s permission \u2013 along with an insistence from Hillary to use Aoraki / Mount Cook rather than Mount Everest in the backdrop . The image also features a Ferguson TE20 tractor like the one Hillary used to reach the South Pole on the Commonwealth Trans - Antarctic Expedition . A bronze statue of \" Sir Ed \" was installed outside The Hermitage hotel at Mount Cook Village , New Zealand , in 2003 . On 17 June 2004 Hillary was awarded Commander ' s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland . To mark the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest the Nepalese government conferred honorary citizenship upon Hillary at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in Kathmandu , Nepal . He was the first foreign national to receive that honour . In 2005 a poll conducted by Reader ' s Digest put Hillary as \" New Zealand ' s most trusted individual \" , beating cyclist Sarah Ulmer and film director Peter Jackson . He kept the title in 2006 and 2007 After his death in 2008 he was succeeded by Willie Apiata VC , a Corporal in the NZSAS . Two Antarctic features are named after Hillary .

The museum houses an art collection of world importance , including significant examples of European , Asian , and American art , from paintings and sculpture to tapestries and decorative arts . In 1990 , thirteen of the museum ' s works were stolen ; the high - profile crime remains unsolved and the artwork ' s location is still unknown . Today , the museum hosts exhibitions of historic and contemporary art , as well as concerts , lectures , family and community programs , and changing courtyard displays . In accordance with the will of Isabella Stewart Gardner , admittance is discounted to those wearing Boston Red Sox memorabilia , and is free to anyone named Isabella . History The museum was incorporated in 1900 and opened in 1903 by Isabella Stewart Gardner ( 1840 \u2013 1924 ) , an American art collector , philanthropist , and patron of the arts . It is housed in a building designed to emulate a 15th - century Venetian palace , drawing particular inspiration from the Venetian Palazzo Barbaro . Gardner began collecting seriously after she received a large inheritance from her father in 1891 . Her purchase of Vermeer ' s The Concert at auction in Paris in 1892 was her first major acquisition . In 1894 , Bernard Berenson offered his services in helping her acquire a Botticelli . With his help , Gardner became the first American to own a painting by the Renaissance master . Berenson helped acquire nearly 70 works of art for her collection .",

Among the artists represented in the galleries are Titian , Rembrandt , Michelangelo , Raphael , Botticelli , Manet , Degas , Whistler and Sargent . The first Matisse to enter an American collection is housed in the Yellow Room . Well - known artworks in the museum ' s collection include Titian ' s The Rape of Europa , John Singer Sargent ' s El Jaleo and Portrait of Isabella Stewart Gardner , Fra Angelico ' s Death and Assumption of the Virgin , Rembrandt ' s Self - Portrait , Aged 23 , Cellini ' s Bindo Altoviti , and Piero della Francesca ' s Hercules . The archives hold more than 7,000 letters from 1,000 correspondents , including Henry Adams , T.S . Eliot , Sarah Bernhardt , and Oliver Wendell Holmes , in addition to travel albums , dealer receipts , and guest books . The galleries also contain Isabella Stewart Gardner ' s little - known but extensive book collection that includes early - print editions and manuscripts of Dante , works by miniaturist Jean Bourdichon , incunables , and illuminated manuscripts . Extension and preservation project In 2002 , after a two - year master planning process , the museum ' s board of trustees determined that a new wing was necessary to preserve the historic building and to provide improved spaces for programs that continue Isabella Gardner ' s legacy . In 2004 , Pritzker Prize \u2013 winning architect Renzo Piano and the Renzo Piano Building Workshop ( Genoa , Italy ) were selected to design the new wing . The design for the new wing is conceived as a respectful complement to the historic Museum building in scale , form , and materials . In March 2009 , the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts approved the museum ' s plans , confirming that the project is consistent with the primary purpose of Isabella Stewart Gardner ' s will and is in the public interest . The project also received approval from all relevant city and state preservation and development review agencies . The new expansion includes spaces for visitor services , concerts , special exhibitions , and education and landscape programs , furthering Isabella Gardner ' s legacy in art , music , and horticulture while reducing 21st - century strain on the collection and galleries . The completion date was 2012 , and the project cost $ 118 million .",

She purchased land for the museum in the marshy Fenway area of Boston , and hired architect Willard T. Sears to build a museum modeled on the Renaissance palaces of Venice . Gardner was deeply involved in every aspect of the design , though , leading Sears to quip that he was merely the structural engineer making Gardner ' s design possible . After the construction of the building was complete , Gardner spent a full year carefully installing her collection in a way that evokes intimate responses to the art , mixing paintings , furniture , textiles and objects from different cultures and periods among well - known European paintings and sculpture . The gallery installations were very different than they appear today . The Room of Early Italian Paintings , for example , served as her Chinese Room until about 1914 . The museum opened on January 1 , 1903 with a grand celebration featuring a performance by members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and a menu that included champagne and doughnuts . During Gardner ' s lifetime , she welcomed artists , performers , and scholars to Fenway Court to draw inspiration from the rich collection and dazzling Venetian setting , including John Singer Sargent , Charles Martin Loeffler , and Ruth St. Denis , among others . Gardner also occasionally hosted artists ' exhibitions within Fenway Court , including one of Anna Coleman Ladd . Today , the museum ' s contemporary artist - in - residence program , courtyard garden displays , concerts , and innovative education programs continue Isabella Gardner ' s legacy . When Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 , her will created an endowment of $ 1 million and outlined stipulations for the support of the museum , including the charge that her collection be permanently exhibited \" for the education and enjoyment of the public forever \" according to her aesthetic vision and intent . Gardner stipulated that if her wishes for the museum were not honored , the property and collection were to be sold and the money given to Harvard University .",

Sears to design the building near the marshy Back Bay Fens to house her growing art collection . Inside the museum , three floors of galleries surround a garden courtyard blooming with life in all seasons . It is a common misconception that the building was brought to America from Venice and reconstructed . It was built from the ground up in Boston out of new materials , incorporating numerous architectural fragments from European Gothic and Renaissance structures . Antique elements are worked into the design of the turn - of - the - century building . Special tiles were custom designed for the floors , modern concrete was used for some of the structural elements , and antique capitals sit atop modern columns . The interior garden courtyard is covered by a glass roof , with steel support structure original to the building . The Gardner Museum is much admired for the intimate atmosphere in which its works of art are displayed and for its flower - filled courtyard . Most of the art pieces are unlabeled , and the generally low lighting is more akin to a private house than a modern art museum . In 2013 , the museum was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission . Collection",

The total worth of the stolen pieces has been estimated at $ 500 million , making the robbery the greatest single property theft in world history . Among the stolen works was The Concert , one of only 34 known works by Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting at over $ 200 million . Also missing is The Storm on the Sea of Galilee , Rembrandt ' s only known seascape . Despite efforts by the FBI , the works have not yet been recovered . The case remains unsolved , with the museum offering a reward of $ 5 million for information leading to recovery of the art . Empty frames hang in the Dutch Room gallery as placeholders for the missing works , in hopeful expectation of their return . The selection of stolen works puzzled experts , as more valuable artworks were present in the museum . According to the FBI , the stolen artwork was moved through the region and offered for sale in Philadelphia during the early 2000s . They believe the thieves were members of a criminal organization based in the mid - Atlantic and New England . Current programs The Gardner Museum regularly produces scholarly exhibitions \u2013 along with lectures , family programs , and symposia \u2013 that provide insights into the historic collection . Through the Gardner ' s Artist - in - Residence program , artists in many disciplines are invited to live at and draw inspiration from the museum .

Cruel is too kind a word to describe their behavior . The principal black men in The Color Purple use their women \u2013 both wives and daughters \u2013 as sexual chattel . \" New York Times film critic Janet Maslin noted the film ' s divergence from Walker ' s book , but made the case that this shift works : Variety found the film over - sentimental , writing , \" there are some great scenes and great performances in The Color Purple , but it is not a great film . Steven Spielberg ' s turn at ' serious ' film - making is marred in more than one place by overblown production that threatens to drown in its own emotions . \" In addition , some critics alleged that the movie stereotyped black people in general and black men in particular , pointing to the fact that Spielberg , a white man , had directed a predominantly African American story .",

Star Trek : The Original Series addressed issues of the 1960s , just as later spin - offs have reflected issues of their respective decades . Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace , the value of personal loyalty , authoritarianism , imperialism , class warfare , economics , racism , religion , human rights , sexism , feminism , and the role of technology . Roddenberry stated : \" [ By creating ] a new world with new rules , I could make statements about sex , religion , Vietnam , politics , and intercontinental missiles . Indeed , we did make them on Star Trek : we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network . \" Roddenberry intended the show to have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter - culture of the youth movement , though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this . He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into , if it would learn from the lessons of the past , most specifically by ending violence . An extreme example is the alien species , the Vulcans , who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions . Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti - war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal , optimistic version of the United Nations . His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability , e.g. , they opposed Roddenberry ' s insistence that the Enterprise have a racially diverse crew . Star Trek has also been accused of evincing racism and imperialism , however , by frequently depicting Starfleet and the Federation trying to impose their values and customs on other planets . Mythology The central trio of Kirk , Spock and McCoy from Star Trek : The Original Series was modeled on classical mythological storytelling . William Shatner said : \u201c There is a mythological component [ to pop culture ] , especially with science fiction . It \u2019 s people looking for answers \u2013 and science fiction offers to explain the inexplicable , the same as religion tends to do\u2026 If we accept the premise that it has a mythological element , then all the stuff about going out into space and meeting new life \u2013 trying to explain it and put a human element to it \u2013 it \u2019 s a hopeful vision .

The series ' newfound success led to the idea of reviving the franchise . Filmation with Paramount Television produced the first post original series show , Star Trek : The Animated Series . It ran on NBC for 22 half - hour episodes over two seasons on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1974 . Although short - lived , typical for animated productions in that time slot during that period , the series garnered the franchise ' s only \" Best Series \" Emmy Award as opposed to the franchise ' s later technical ones . Paramount Pictures and Roddenberry began developing a new series , Star Trek : Phase II , in May 1975 in response to the franchise ' s newfound popularity . Work on the series ended , however , when the proposed Paramount Television Service folded . Following the success of the science fiction movies Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Paramount adapted the planned pilot episode of Phase II into the feature film , Star Trek : The Motion Picture . The film opened in North America on December 7 , 1979 , with mixed reviews from critics . The film earned $ 139 million worldwide , below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel . The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels . The success of the critically acclaimed sequel , Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , reversed the fortunes of the franchise . While the sequel grossed less than the first movie , The Wrath of Khans lower production costs made it net more profit . Paramount produced six Star Trek feature films between 1979 and 1991 . In response to the popularity of Star Trek feature films , the franchise returned to television with Star Trek : The Next Generation ( TNG ) in 1987 .

                    "context": "Hook is a 1991 American fantasy adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by James V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo . It stars Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook , Robin Williams as Peter Pan / Peter Banning , Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell , Bob Hoskins as Smee , Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy , Caroline Goodall as Moira Banning , and Charlie Korsmo as Jack Banning . The film acts as a sequel to J. M. Barrie ' s 1911 novel Peter and Wendy focusing on an adult Peter Pan who has forgotten all about his childhood . In his new life , Peter Pan is known as Peter Banning , a successful but unimaginative corporate lawyer with a wife ( Wendy ' s granddaughter ) and two children . However , when the old enemy of his past , Hook , kidnaps his children , Peter once again returns to Neverland in order to save them . Along the journey Peter reclaims his youthful spirit that unlocks the memory to his past . Spielberg began developing the film in the early 1980s with Walt Disney Productions and Paramount Pictures , which would have followed the story line seen in the 1924 silent film and 1953 animated film . Peter Pan entered pre - production in 1985 , but Spielberg abandoned the project . James V. Hart developed the script with director , Nick Castle and TriStar Pictures before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989 . Hook was shot almost entirely on sound stages at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City , California . The film received mixed reviews from critics , and while it was a commercial success , its box office intake was lower than expected . Hook was nominated in five categories at the 64th Academy Awards . It also spawned merchandise , including video games , action figures , and comic book adaptations . Plot Peter Banning is a successful corporate lawyer living in San Francisco . However , he is a workaholic , spending little time with his wife Moira and children Jack and Maggie , missing Jack \u2019 s baseball game . The family fly to London to visit Moira \u2019 s grandmother Wendy Darling and attend a banquet ceremony at Great Ormond Street Hospital honouring Wendy \u2019 s charity work . However , a supernatural presence abducts Jack and Maggie , and a signed letter indicates Captain Hook is responsible , a truth supported by elderly and senile Tootles . Wendy informs Peter he is in fact an adult Peter Pan , but lost all of his childhood memories when he fell in love with Moira . Peter gets drunk , only for Tinker Bell to appear and take him to Neverland to rescue his children from Hook .",

Previous Spielberg films that explored a dysfunctional father - son relationship included E.T . the Extra - Terrestrial and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade . Peter Banning ' s \" quest for success \" paralleled Spielberg starting out as a film director and transforming into a Hollywood business magnate . \" I think a lot of people today are losing their imagination because they are work - driven . They are so self - involved with work and success and arriving at the next plateau that children and family almost become incidental . I have even experienced it myself when I have been on a very tough shoot and I ' ve not seen my kids except on weekends . They ask for my time and I ca n ' t give it to them because I ' m working . \" Like Peter Banning at the beginning of Hook , Spielberg has a fear of flying . He feels that Peter Pan ' s \" enduring quality \" in the storyline is simply to fly . \" Anytime anything flies , whether it ' s Superman , Batman , or E.T. , it ' s got to be a tip of the hat to Peter Pan , \" Spielberg reflected in a 1992 interview . \" Peter Pan was the first time I saw anybody fly . Before I saw Superman , before I saw Batman , and of course before I saw any superheroes , my first memory of anybody flying is in Peter Pan . \" Pre - production J. M. Barrie considered writing a story in which Peter Pan grew up ; his 1920 notes for the latest stage revival of Peter Pan included possible titles for another play : The Man Who Could n ' t Grow Up or The Old Age of Peter Pan . The genesis of Hook started when director Steven Spielberg ' s mother often read him Peter and Wendy as a bedtime story . Spielberg explained in 1985 , \" When I was eleven years old I actually directed the story during a school production . I have always felt like Peter Pan . I still feel like Peter Pan . It has been very hard for me to grow up , I ' m a victim of the Peter Pan syndrome . \"",

Roberts received a record US $ 25 million for her portrayal of a forward - thinking art history professor at Wellesley College in 1953 \u2013 the highest ever earned by an actress until then . The film garnered largely lukewarm reviews by critics , who found it \" predictable and safe \" . In 2004 , Roberts replaced Cate Blanchett in Mike Nichols ' s Closer , a romantic drama film written by Patrick Marber , based on his award - winning 1997 play of the same name . The film also starred Jude Law , Natalie Portman and Clive Owen . Also in 2004 , the actress reprised the role of Tess Ocean in the sequel Ocean ' s Twelve . That movie was deliberately much more unconventional than the first , epitomized by a sequence in which Roberts ' character impersonates the real - life Julia Roberts due to their strong resemblance . Though less favored than Eleven , the film became another major success at the box offices with a gross of US $ 363 million worldwide , mostly from its international run . Unlike all the male cast members , Roberts did not appear in the series ' third and final installment Ocean ' s Thirteen ( 2007 ) due to script issues . In 2005 , she was featured in the music video for the single \" Dreamgirl \" by the Dave Matthews Band ; it was her first music video appearance . Roberts appeared in The Hollywood Reporters list of the 10 highest - paid actresses every year from 2002 ( when the magazine began compiling its list ) to 2005 . Roberts had two films released in 2006 : The Ant Bully and Charlotte ' s Web . Both films were animated features for which she provided voice acting . Her next film was Charlie Wilson ' s War ( 2007 ) , with Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman , directed by Mike Nichols ; it was released on December 21 , 2007 . Fireflies in the Garden ( 2008 ) , also starring Ryan Reynolds and Willem Dafoe , was released at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2008 and was subsequently shown in European cinemas ; it did not get a North American release until 2011 .",

                    "context": "Hopkins ' most famous role is as the cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs , for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 , with Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling , who also won for Best Actress . The film won Best Picture , Best Director and Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay . Hopkins reprised his role as Lecter twice ; in Ridley Scott ' s Hannibal ( 2001 ) , and Red Dragon ( 2002 ) . His original portrayal of the character in The Silence of the Lambs has been labelled by the AFI as the number - one film villain . At the time he was offered the role , Hopkins was making a return to the London stage , performing in M. Butterfly . He had come back to Britain after living for a number of years in Hollywood , having all but given up on a career there , saying , \" Well that part of my life ' s over ; it ' s a chapter closed . I suppose I ' ll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life . \" Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by Thomas Harris . The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins ' portrayal of his antagonist . However , Hopkins stated that Red Dragon would feature his final performance as the character , and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series , Hannibal Rising . Acting style Hopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles . He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project , he will go over his lines as many times as is needed ( sometimes upwards of 200 ) until the lines sound natural to him , so that he can \" do it without thinking \" . This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand . While it can allow for some careful improvisation , it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script , or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes . Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene , he simply discards the lines , not remembering them later on . This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film , even years later .",

In the same year , as part of the restoration process for the Stanley Kubrick film Spartacus , Hopkins was approached to re - record lines from a scene that was being added back to the film ; this scene featured Laurence Olivier and Tony Curtis , with Hopkins recommended by Olivier ' s widow , Joan Plowright to perform her late husband ' s part thanks to his talent for mimicry . In 1996 , he directed August , an adaptation of Chekhov ' s Uncle Vanya set in Wales . His first screenplay , an experimental drama called Slipstream , which he also directed and scored , premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007 . In 1997 , Hopkins narrated the BBC natural documentary series , Killing for a Living , which showed predatory behaviour in nature . He narrated episode 1 through 3 before being replaced by John Shrapnel . Hopkins is a fan of the BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses , and once remarked in an interview how he would love to appear in the series . Writer John Sullivan saw the interview , and with Hopkins in mind created the character Danny Driscoll , a local villain . However , filming of the new series coincided with the filming of The Silence of the Lambs , making Hopkins unavailable . The role instead went to Roy Marsden . On 31 October 2011 , Andr\u00e9 Rieu released an album including a waltz which Hopkins had composed many years before , at the age of nineteen . Hopkins had never heard his composition , \" And the Waltz Goes On \" , before it was premiered by Rieu ' s orchestra in Vienna ; Rieu ' s album was given the same name as Hopkins ' piece . In January 2012 , Hopkins released an album of classical music , entitled Composer , performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra , and released on CD via the UK radio station Classic FM . The album consists of nine of his original works and film scores , with one of the pieces titled \" Margam \" in tribute to his home town near Port Talbot in Wales . In October 2015 , Hopkins appeared as Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood ' s The Dresser , alongside Ian McKellen , Edward Fox and Emily Watson . The Dresser is set in a London theatre during the Blitz , where an aging actor - manager , Sir , prepares for his starring role in King Lear with the help of his devoted dresser , Norman .",

Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film . The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as \" a multi - dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure \" . It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again . Omnipresent are the boundaries of the films budget . Additionally , the director may also have to ensure an intended age rating . Theoretically the sole superior of a director is the studio that is financing the film , however a poor working relationship between a film director and an actor could possibly result in the director being replaced if the actor is a major film star . Even so , it is arguable that the director spends more time on a project than anyone else , considering that the director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production . Thus , the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one . It has been said that \" 20 - hour days are not unusual \" . Under European Union law , the film director is considered the \" author \" or one of the authors of a film , largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory . Auteur theory is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director ' s film reflects the director ' s personal creative vision , as if they were the primary \" auteur \" ( the French word for \" author \" ) . In spite of \u2013 and sometimes even because of \u2013 the production of the film as part of an industrial process , the auteur ' s creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process .

Generally , a film director controls a film ' s artistic and dramatic aspects , and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision .

The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized , or noticed . Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay in the boundaries of the film ' s budget . There are many pathways to becoming a film director . Some film directors started as screenwriters , cinematographers , film editors or actors . Other film directors have attended a film school . Directors use different approaches . Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue , while others control every aspect , and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely . Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long - standing writing partners . Some directors edit or appear in their films , or compose the music score for their films . Responsibility Film directors create an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized / noticed . Realizing this vision includes overseeing the artistic and technical elements of film production , as well as directing the shooting timetable and meeting deadlines . This entails organizing the film crew in such a way as to achieve their vision of the film . This requires skills of group leadership , as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful , fast - paced environment of a film set . Moreover , it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew , thus , excellent communication skills are a must .",

To prepare for the role , Glenn met with John E. Douglas , after whom the character is modeled . Douglas gave Glenn a tour of the Quantico facility and also played for him an audio tape containing various recordings that serial killers Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris had made of themselves raping and torturing a 16 - year - old girl . According to Douglas , Glenn wept as he experienced the recordings and even changed his liberal stance on the death penalty . Filming Principal photography for The Silence of the Lambs began on November 15 , 1989 and concluded on March 1 , 1990 . Filming primarily took place in and around Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , with some scenes shot in nearby northern West Virginia . The home of Buffalo Bill used for exterior scenes was in Layton , Pennsylvania . The exterior of the Western Center near Canonsburg , Pennsylvania served as the setting for Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane . In what was a rare act of cooperation at the time , the FBI allowed scenes to be filmed at the FBI Academy in Quantico ; some FBI staff members even acted in bit parts . Music The musical score for The Silence of the Lambs was composed by Howard Shore , who would also go on to collaborate with Demme on Philadelphia . Recorded in Munich during the latter half of the summer of 1990 , the score was performed by the Munich Symphony Orchestra . \" I tried to write in a way that goes right into the fabric of the movie , \" explained Shore on his approach . \" I tried to make the music just fit in . When you watch the movie you are not aware of the music . You get your feelings from all elements simultaneously , lighting , cinematography , costumes , acting , music . Jonathan Demme was very specific about the music . \" The tune played by the music box which Starling finds in the bedroom of Buffalo Bill ' s first victim is taken from Mozart ' s opera The Magic Flute . It is , ironically , the tune played by Papageno ' s magical bells , which charms his enemies and protects him from danger . A soundtrack album was released by MCA Records on February 5 , 1991 . Music from the film was later used in the trailers for its sequel , Hannibal . Release",

The site ' s consensus reads : \" Director Jonathan Demme ' s smart , taut thriller teeters on the edge between psychological study and all - out horror , and benefits greatly from stellar performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster . \" Metacritic , another review aggregator , assigned the film a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 , based on 17 reviews from mainstream critics , indicating \" universal acclaim \" . Roger Ebert , of the Chicago Sun - Times , specifically mentioned the \" terrifying qualities \" of Hannibal Lecter . Ebert later added the film to his list of The Great Movies , recognizing the film as a \" horror masterpiece \" alongside such classics as Nosferatu , Psycho , and Halloween . However , the film is also notable for being one of two multi - Academy Award winners ( the other being Unforgiven ) disapproved of by Ebert ' s colleague , Gene Siskel . Writing for the Chicago Tribune , Siskel said , \" Foster ' s character , who is appealing , is dwarfed by the monsters she is after . I ' d rather see her work on another case . \" Accolades",

                    "context": "Some film directors started as screenwriters , film editors or actors . Several American cinematographers have become directors , including Barry Sonnenfeld , originally the Coen brothers ' DP ; Jan de Bont , cinematographer on films as Die Hard and Basic Instinct , directed Speed and Twister . Recently Wally Pfister , cinematographer on Christopher Nolan ' s three Batman films made his directorial debut with Transcendence . Other film directors have attended a film school to \" get formal training and education in their craft \" . Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film . This includes , for example , preparation , shot lists and storyboards , blocking , protocols of dealing with professional actors , and reading scripts . Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post - production facilities . Besides basic technical and logistical skills , students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production . A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying . Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment . The National Film School of Denmark has the student ' s final projects presented on national TV . Some film schools retain the rights for their students ' works . Many directors successfully prepared for making feature films by working in television . The German Film and Television Academy Berlin consequently cooperates with the Berlin / Brandenburg TV station RBB ( Berlin - Brandenburg Broadcasting ) and ARTE . A handful of top directors made from $ 13 million to $ 257 million in 2011 , such as James Cameron and Steven Spielberg . In May 2011 , the average United States film director made $ 122,220 . Characteristics Different directors can vary immensely amongst themselves , under various characteristics . Several examples are : * Those who outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue . Notable examples include Ingmar Bergman , Christopher Guest , Spike Lee , Wim Wenders , Mike Leigh , Barry Levinson , Jean - Luc Godard , Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3 , Gus Van Sant , Judd Apatow , Terrence Malick , Harmony Korine , Jay and Mark Duplass , and occasionally Robert Altman , Joe Swanberg , Sergio Leone and Federico Fellini . * Those who control every aspect , and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely . Notable examples include David Lean , Akira Kurosawa , Steven Spielberg , Ridley Scott , Victor Fleming , Erich von Stroheim , James Cameron , George Lucas , Stanley Kubrick , Sidney Lumet , Andrew Bujalski , Christopher Nolan , David Fincher , Guillermo del Toro and Alfred Hitchcock .",

                    "context": "Concern about the rapid pace of technological change crystallized around the concept of the technological singularity , popularized by Vernor Vinge ' s novel Marooned in Realtime and then taken up by other authors . The term \" sci - fi \" Forrest J Ackerman is credited with first using the term sci - fi ( analogous to the then - trendy \" hi - fi \" ) in 1954 . As science fiction entered popular culture , writers and fans active in the field came to associate the term with low - budget , low - tech \" B - movies \" and with low - quality pulp science fiction . By the 1970s , critics within the field such as Terry Carr and Damon Knight were using sci - fi to distinguish hack - work from serious science fiction . Around 1978 critic Susan Wood and others introduced the use of the odd pronunciation \" skiffy \" which is intended to be self - deprecating humor but is inconsistent with the documented genesis of the term \" sci - fi \" ( i.e. , one would not pronounce \" hi - fi \" as \" hiffy \" ) and Ackerman ' s own words engraved on his crypt plaque which read \" Sci - Fi was My High \" . Peter Nicholls writes that \" SF \" ( or \" sf \" ) is \" the preferred abbreviation within the community of sf writers and readers . \" David Langford ' s monthly fanzine Ansible includes a regular section \" As Others See Us \" which offers numerous examples of \" sci - fi \" being used in a pejorative sense by people outside the genre . Innovation Science fiction has criticized developing and future technologies , but also initiates innovation and new technology . This topic has been more often discussed in literary and sociological than in scientific forums . Cinema and media theorist Vivian Sobchack examines the dialogue between science fiction films and the technological imagination . Technology impacts artists and how they portray their fictionalized subjects , but the fictional world gives back to science by broadening imagination . How William Shatner Changed the World is a documentary that gave a number of real - world examples of actualized technological imaginations . While more prevalent in the early years of science fiction with writers like Arthur C. Clarke , new authors still find ways to make currently impossible technologies seem closer to being realized .

Detecting a mysterious transmission , possibly a distress signal , from a nearby planetoid , the ship ' s computer , MOTHER , awakens the crew . Following standard company policy for such situations , the Nostromo lands on the planetoid and Dallas , Kane , and Lambert head out to investigate , damaging their ship upon landing in dust . They discover the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft . Inside , they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribcage appears to have exploded from the inside . On the Nostromo , Ripley determines that the transmission is not a distress signal but a warning . In the alien ship , Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of eggs . As he inspects one , a creature springs out , spits acid through his space helmet and attaches itself to his face . Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo . As acting senior officer , Ripley refuses to let them aboard , citing quarantine regulations , but Ash violates protocol by overriding Ripley ' s lock and letting them in . The crew are unable to remove the creature from Kane ' s face , as its grip is strong and its blood is an extremely corrosive acid . It eventually lets go , crawls away , and dies . The crew repair the ship and lift off . Kane awakens and seems healthy , but during the crew ' s final meal before re - entering stasis , he chokes and convulses in pain before a small alien creature bursts from his chest , killing him , and escapes into the depths of the ship . Since attacking the creature with conventional weapons could result in its corrosive blood breaching the ship ' s hull , the crew attempts to locate and capture it with motion trackers , nets , electric prods , and flamethrowers .",

                    "context": "Science fiction is a genre of speculative fiction dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology , space travel , time travel , faster than light travel , parallel universes and extraterrestrial life . Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations , and has been called a \" literature of ideas . \" It usually eschews the supernatural , and unlike the related genre of fantasy , historically science fiction stories were intended to have at least a faint grounding in science - based fact or theory at the time the story was created , but this connection has become tenuous or non - existent in much of science fiction . Definitions Science fiction is difficult to define , as it includes a wide range of subgenres and themes . Author and editor Damon Knight summed up the difficulty , saying \" science fiction is what we point to when we say it \" , a definition echoed by author Mark C. Glassy , who argues that the definition of science fiction is like the definition of pornography : you do not know what it is , but you know it when you see it . Hugo Gernsback , who was one of the first in using the term \" science fiction \" , described his vision of the genre : \" By ' scientifiction ' I mean the Jules Verne , H. G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe type of story \u2013 a charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision . \" In 1970 William Atheling Jr. wrote about the English term \" science fiction \" : \" Wells used the term originally to cover what we would today call \u2018 hard \u2019 science fiction , in which a conscientious attempt to be faithful to already known facts ( as of the date of writing ) was the substrate on which the story was to be built , and if the story was also to contain a miracle , it ought at least not to contain a whole arsenal of them . \"",

The film ' s title refers to a highly aggressive extraterrestrial creature that stalks and kills the crew of a spaceship . Dan O ' Bannon wrote the screenplay from a story he wrote with Ronald Shusett , drawing influence from previous works of science fiction and horror . The film was produced by Gordon Carroll , David Giler and Walter Hill through their Brandywine Productions and distributed by 20th Century Fox . Giler and Hill made revisions and additions to the script . Shusett was executive producer . The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger , while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the human aspects of the film . Alien launched the Alien franchise and is chronologically the first of the main series , with the prequel series set in an earlier timeframe . Alien received both critical acclaim and box office success , receiving an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects , Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film , Best Direction for Scott , and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright , and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , along with numerous other award nominations . It has remained highly praised in subsequent decades , being considered one of the greatest films of all time . In 2002 the film was deemed \" culturally , historically or aesthetically significant \" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry . In 2008 , it was ranked as the seventh - best film in the science fiction genre by the American Film Institute , and as the 33rd greatest film of all time by Empire magazine . The success of Alien spawned a media franchise of novels , comic books , video games , and toys . It also launched Weaver ' s acting career by providing her with her first lead role , and the story of her character Ripley ' s encounters with the Alien creatures became the thematic thread that ran through the sequels Aliens ( 1986 ) , Alien 3 ( 1992 ) and Alien : Resurrection ( 1997 ) . A prequel series , which includes Prometheus ( 2012 ) and Alien : Covenant ( 2017 ) , continues in development . Plot",

Kotto was sent a script off the back of his recent success with Live and Let Die , although it took some time and deliberation between Kotto and his agent before he was offered the part . * Bolaji Badejo as The Alien Nigerian Badejo , while a 26 - year - old design student , was discovered in a bar by a member of the casting team , who put him in touch with Ridley Scott . Scott believed that Badejo , at 6 ft ( 7ft . inside the costume ) and with a slender frame , could portray the Alien and look as if his arms and legs were too long to be real , creating the illusion that there could not possibly be a human being inside the costume . Stuntmen Eddie Powell and Roy Scammell also portrayed the Alien in some scenes . * Helen Horton as the voice of Mother , the Nostromo ' s computer .

G. Wells and Jules Verne , or real technological developments like the computer occurring at an earlier date . Popular examples include The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling , Leviathan series by Scott Westerfeld , Bas - Lag series by China Mi\u00e9ville , as well as Girl Genius web comic by Phil and Kaja Foglio , although seeds of the subgenre may be seen in certain works of Michael Moorcock , Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer and Steve Stiles , and in such games as Space : 1889 and Marcus Rowland ' s Forgotten Futures . Machines are most often powered by steam in this genre ( hence the name ) . Terry Gilliam ' s 1985 film Brazil is seen as inspiration for writers and artists of the steampunk sub - culture . * Science fiction opera is an opera in a science fiction setting without an outer space or multi - planetary setting , thereby distinguishing it from Space opera . * Sci - fi action - Sharing many of the conventions of a science fiction film , sci - fi action films emphasizes gun - play , space battles , invented weaponry , and other sci - fi elements weaved into action film premises . Examples include G.I . Samurai , Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , The Matrix , Total Recall , Minority Report , The Island , Star Wars , Aliens , I Robot , Transformers , The Hunger Games , The Maze Runner , Equilibrium , District 9 , Serenity , Akira , Paycheck , Predator , Robocop , Avatar , Mad Max 2 , Divergent , They Live , Escape From New York and The Fifth Element . * Science fiction horror \u2013 Often revolves around subjects that include but are not limited to killer aliens , mad scientists , and / or experiments gone wrong . * Dieselpunk takes over where Steampunk leaves off . These are stories that take over as we usher in the machine - heavy eras of WWI and WWII . The use of diesel - powered machines plays heavily . In this ( like its steam counterpart ) , the focus is on the technology .",

Roger Ebert wrote that the film \" provides a good time , high style , a loving salute to an earlier period of filmmaking \" . The New York Times chief critic of the era , Vincent Canby , pointed out that \" had Dame Agatha Christie ' s \" Murder on the Orient Express \" been made into a movie 40 years ago ( when it was published here as \" Murder on the Calais Coach \" ) , it would have been photographed in black - and - white on a back lot in Burbank or Culver City , with one or two stars and a dozen character actors and studio contract players . Its running time would have been around 67 minutes and it could have been a very respectable B - picture . \" Murder on the Orient Express \" was n ' t made into a movie 40 years ago , and after you see the Sidney Lumet production that opened yesterday at the Coronet , you may be both surprised and glad it was n ' t . An earlier adaptation could have interfered with plans to produce this terrifically entertaining super - valentine to a kind of whodunit that may well be one of the last fixed points in our inflationary universe . \" Awards and nominations Other films It was the first of a number of \" all star \" adaptations of Agatha Christie novels in the 1970s and early 1980s .

It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east , and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge - tunnel across the \u00d6resund . At 450295 km2 , Sweden is the third - largest country in the European Union by area , with a total population of over 9.8 million . Sweden consequently has a low population density of 21 PD / km2 , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country . Approximately 85 % of the population lives in urban areas . Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times , emerging into history as the Geats / G\u00f6tar and Swedes / Svear and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen . Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural , while the north is heavily forested . Sweden is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia . The climate is in general very mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence , that in spite of this still retains warm continental summers . Today , Sweden is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , with a monarch as head of state . The capital city is Stockholm , which is also the most populous city in the country . Legislative power is vested in the 349 - member unicameral Riksdag . Executive power is exercised by the government chaired by the prime minister . Sweden is a unitary state , currently divided into 21 counties and 290 municipalities . Sweden emerged as an independent and unified country during the Middle Ages . In the 17th century , it expanded its territories to form the Swedish Empire , which became one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th century . Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries , ending with the annexation of present - day Finland by Russia in 1809 . The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 , when Norway was militarily forced into personal union . Since then , Sweden has been at peace , maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign affairs . The union with Norway was peacefully dissolved in 1905 , leading to Sweden ' s current borders . Though Sweden was formally neutral through both world wars , Sweden engaged in humanitarian efforts , such as taking in refugees from German - occupied Europe .",

It is also a member of the United Nations , the Nordic Council , Council of Europe , the World Trade Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development ( OECD ) . Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens . It has the world ' s eighth - highest per capita income and ranks highly in numerous metrics of national performance , including quality of life , health , education , protection of civil liberties , economic competitiveness , equality , prosperity and human development . Etymology The modern name Sweden is derived through back - formation from Old English Sw\u0113o\u00fe\u0113od , which meant \" people of the Swedes \" ( Old Norse Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0 , Latin Suetidi ) . This word is derived from Sweon / Sweonas ( Old Norse Sviar , Latin Suiones ) . The Swedish name Sverige ( a compound of the words Svea and Rike , with lenition of the consonant [ k ] , first recorded in the cognate Sw\u0113orice in Beowulf ) literally means \" Realm of the Swedes \" , excluding the Geats in G\u00f6taland . Variations of the name Sweden are used in most languages , with the exception of Danish and Norwegian using Sverige , Faroese Sv\u00f8r\u00edki , Icelandic Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0 , and the more notable exception of some Finnic languages where Ruotsi ( Finnish ) and Rootsi ( Estonian ) are used , names commonly considered etymologically related to the English name for Russia , referring to the people , Rus ' , originally from the coastal areas of Roslagen , Uppland . The etymology of Swedes , and thus Sweden , is generally not agreed upon but may derive from Proto - Germanic Swihoniz meaning \" one ' s own \" , referring to one ' s own Germanic tribe . History Prehistory Sweden ' s prehistory begins in the Aller\u00f8d oscillation , a warm period around 12,000 BC , with Late Palaeolithic reindeer - hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the country ' s southernmost province , Scania . This period was characterised by small bands of hunter - gatherer - fishers using flint technology .",

They enlist the help of Dr. Constantine ( George Coulouris ) , a Greek medical doctor who was travelling in another coach with Bianchi as the only other passenger and thus is not a suspect . Pierre Michel ( Jean - Pierre Cassel ) , the middle - aged French conductor of the car , also assists the investigation , as well as being a suspect . Poirot soon discovers that Ratchett was n ' t who he claimed to be and his secret past indicates a clear motive for his murder . Clues Dr. Constantine ' s examination reveals that Ratchett was stabbed 12 times . Some wounds were slight , but at least three of them could have resulted in death . The stopped watch in the victim ' s pocket , as well as Poirot ' s reconstructed timeline of passenger activities the night before , indicate that Ratchett was murdered at about 1:15 a.m . The train had stopped , surrounded by fresh snow , before that time . There are no tracks in the snow and the doors to the other cars were locked , so the murderer is almost certainly still among the passengers in the coach . Poirot discovers that Ratchett ' s real name was Lanfranco Cassetti , a Mafia gangster who five years before planned and carried out the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong , infant daughter of a wealthy British Army colonel who had settled in America with his American wife . The kidnappers demanded a ransom ; but after it was delivered , instead of returning the child , they murdered her . Overcome with grief , the then - pregnant Mrs. Armstrong went into labor early and died while giving birth to a stillborn baby . A maidservant named Paulette ( Suzanne in the novel ) , who was wrongly suspected of being involved in the kidnapping , committed suicide , only to be found innocent after she took her life . Colonel Armstrong , consumed by these tragedies , later killed himself as well . Cassetti betrayed his partner , leaving him to be executed while he fled the country with the ransom , as he was only revealed to be the leader of the kidnapping plot on the eve of the execution . Poirot , Dr. Constantine , and Bianchi summon the other passengers one by one and proceed to interrogate them .

In Germania 44 and 45 he mentions the Swedes ( Suiones ) as a powerful tribe ( distinguished not merely for their arms and men , but for their powerful fleets ) with ships that had a prow at each end ( longships ) . Which kings ( kuningaz ) ruled these Suiones is unknown , but Norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and semi - legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC . As for literacy in Sweden itself , the runic script was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century AD , but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts , mainly of male names , demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke Proto - Norse at the time , a language ancestral to Swedish and other North Germanic languages . In the 6th century Jordanes named two tribes he calls the Suehans and the Suetidi who lived in Scandza . These two names are both considered to refer to the same tribe . The Suehans , he says , have very fine horses just as the Thyringi tribe ( alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans , quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis ) . Snorri Sturluson wrote that the contemporary Swedish king Adils ( Eadgils ) had the finest horses of his day . The Suehans were the suppliers of black fox skins for the Roman market . Then Jordanes names the Suetidi , which is considered to be the Latin form of Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0 , the Old Norse name for the Swedes . He writes that the Suetidi are the tallest of men together with the Dani who were of the same stock . Later he mentions other Scandinavian tribes for being of the same height . The Vikings The Swedish Viking Age lasted roughly from the 8th century to the 11th century . It is believed that Swedish Vikings and Gutar mainly travelled east and south , going to Finland , the Baltic countries , Russia , Belarus , Ukraine , the Black Sea and even as far as Baghdad . Their routes passed through the Dnieper south to Constantinople , on which they carried out numerous raids . The Byzantine Emperor Theophilos noticed their great skills in war , and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard , known as the Varangian Guard . The Swedish Vikings , called Rus are believed to be the founding fathers of Kievan Rus ' . The Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan described these Vikings as follows :",

Sm\u00e5land was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests , and only the city of Kalmar with its castle was of importance . The south - west parts of the Scandinavian peninsula consisted of three Danish provinces ( Scania , Blekinge and Halland ) . North of Halland Denmark had a direct border to Norway and its province Bohusl\u00e4n . But there were Swedish settlements in south - west Finland , and along the southern coastline of Norrland . During the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age , Ystad in Danish province Scania and Paviken on Gotland , were flourishing centres of trade , but they were not parts of the early Swedish Kingdom . Remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from 600 \u2013 700 AD have been found in Ystad . In Paviken , an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the 9th and 10th century , remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries . Between 800 and 1000 , trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland , and according to some scholars , the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined .",

It was written by Hot Chocolate ' s lead singer Errol Brown , and produced by Mickie Most . It reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in 1975 , and number 3 in the US Pop charts a year later . Billboard ranked it as the No . 22 song for 1976 . The song went on to gain lasting notability by being featured in many hit films , such as 1997 ' s The Full Monty . Quite often , the song is misattributed to Barry White . Overview The song was originally a 1975 B - side . Not yet convinced that the song could be a hit , producer Most put it on the flip - side of the Hot Chocolate single \" Blue Night \" . The song was later remixed by Most , who re - released it as an A - side some months later on his RAK label . The song was a hit and ultimately became the group ' s best - known song . In the UK the song was poised for the no . 1 spot , but was beaten to it by \" Bohemian Rhapsody \" , when on 29 November 1975 the Queen single leaped above it from no . 9 .",

Ten years later , when it was featured in the film , The Full Monty in 1997 , it went to number six in the chart . In one of the most memorable scenes in the film , the male lead , Gaz ( played by Robert Carlyle ) performs a \" striptease \" to the music of \" You Sexy Thing \" . The song is later heard over the closing credits and is also included in the 2013 play version of The Full Monty . \" You Sexy Thing \" has also been heard in other films including Boogie Nights , Reservoir Dogs , Bicentennial Man , Heavyweights , Rat Race , Dude , Where ' s My Car , Deuce Bigalow : Male Gigolo , About Schmidt and Nick and Norah ' s Infinite Playlist , Big Mommas : Like Father , Like Son , and Grown Ups . Another U.S. resurgence in 1999 can be credited to a Burger King television commercial in which the song played while the camera examined a Double Whopper . In 2010 , the song was featured in television advertisements for the series Hot in Cleveland on TV Land , and for the Swiffer Dusters cleaning product . It was featured in a TV commercial for the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado that aired during Fox ' s coverage of Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2 , 2014 . In addition , it is the only song to enter the UK Top Ten in the 1970s , 1980s and 1990s . Structure \" You Sexy Thing \" has a simple structure , with most of the song alternating between two major chords ( F and Bb ) . It has a chorus - verse form . One of the song ' s most memorable aspects is its distinctive six note riff which is repeated intermittently throughout , played on a mildly overdriven electric guitar on a high treble setting and with noticeable vibrato . In addition to a traditional rock drum kit , the song uses hand drums , played in a style reminiscent of tabla . A number of violins accompany the rhythm section . Brown ' s vocals are sung in an energetic soul fashion , accentuated by the occasional high - pitched , Isley Brothers - style scream . Cover versions",

                    "context": "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane ? is a 1962 American psychological thriller film produced and directed by Robert Aldrich , starring Bette Davis and Joan Crawford , about an actress who holds her crippled sister captive in an old Hollywood mansion . The screenplay by Lukas Heller is based on the 1960 novel of the same name by Henry Farrell . Upon the film ' s release it was met with widespread critical and box office acclaim and was later nominated for five Academy Awards , winning one for Best Costume Design , Black and White . The intensely bitter Hollywood rivalry between the film ' s two stars , Bette Davis and Joan Crawford , was heavily important to the film ' s success at the time . This in part led to the revitalization of the then - waning careers of the two stars . In the years after the film ' s release , critics continued to acclaim the film for its psychologically driven black comedy , camp , and creation of the psycho - biddy subgenre . The film ' s then unheard of and controversial plot , meant that it originally received an X rating in the UK , Because of the appeal of the film ' s stars , Dave Itzkoff in The New York Times has identified it as being a \" cult classic \" . In 2003 , the character of Baby Jane Hudson was ranked # 44 on the American Film Institute ' s list of the 50 Best Villains of American Cinema . Plot In 1917 , Baby Jane Hudson is a vaudevillian child star while her sister Blanche Hudson is not famous and overlooked by their father . By 1935 , both sisters are movie actors , but Blanche has achieved stardom , while Jane \u2019 s films have flopped , leading Jane to drink heavily . One night , returning from a party , one of the sisters gets out of the car to open the gate leading up to the house , while the other attempts to run her over . The resulting accident leaves Blanche paralyzed .",

Other residential exteriors show cottages on DeLongpre Avenue near Harvard Avenue in Hollywood without their current gated courtyards . The scene on the beach was shot in Malibu , reportedly the same site where Aldrich filmed the final scene of Kiss Me Deadly ( 1955 ) . Footage from the Bette Davis films Parachute Jumper and Ex - Lady ( both 1933 ) and the Joan Crawford film Sadie McKee ( 1934 ) was utilized , to represent the film acting of Baby Jane and Blanche respectively . The neighbor ' s daughter was played by Davis ' daughter B. D. Merrill who , following in the footsteps of Crawford ' s daughter Christina , later wrote a memoir that depicted her mother in an unfavorable light . It was an open secret that Davis and Crawford loathed each other , and filming was contentious as their real - life hatred for one another spilled over into the production , and even after filming had wrapped .",

                    "context": "Crawford was scheduled to appear alongside Davis on a publicity tour of Baby Jane but cancelled at the last minute . Davis claimed that Crawford backed out because she did n ' t want to share the stage with her . In a 1972 telephone conservation , Crawford related to future author Shaun Considine that after seeing a screening of the film she urged Davis to go and have a look . When she did n ' t hear back from her co - star , Crawford called Davis and asked her what she thought of the film to which Davis replied , \" You were so right , Joan . The picture is good . And I was terrific . \" Crawford replied , \" That was it . She never said anything about my performance . Not a word . \" Considine alleges that this denial from Davis ( with regards to Joan ' s talent as an actress ) prompted Crawford to cancel the publicity tour and upstage Davis at the Oscars . Prior to the Oscars ceremony , Crawford contacted the Best Actress nominees who were unable to attend the ceremonies and offered to accept the award on their behalf should they win . Davis claimed that Crawford lobbied against her among Academy voters . When Anne Bancroft was declared the winner for The Miracle Worker , she was in New York performing in a play , and had asked Crawford to accept her award if she won . Crawford triumphantly swept on - stage to pick up the trophy . Davis later commented , \" It would have meant a million more dollars to our film if I had won . Joan was thrilled I had n ' t . \" As both Davis and Crawford had accepted lower salaries in exchange for a share of the film ' s profits , Davis considered it especially foolish of Crawford to have worked against their common interests , especially at a time when roles for actresses of their generation were hard to find .",

Quirk the difficulty she was having with Davis because of the Oscar incident but added , \" She acted like Baby Jane was a one - woman show after they nominated her . What was I supposed to do , let her hog all the glory , act like I had n ' t even been in the movie ? She got the nomination . I did n ' t begrudge her that , but it would have been nice if she ' d been a little gracious in interviews and given me a little credit . I would have done it for her . \" Legacy The film ' s success led to the birth of the psycho - biddy subgenre of horror / thriller films featuring psychotic older women , among them Aldrich ' s Hush\u2026 Hush , Sweet Charlotte , What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice ? and What ' s the Matter with Helen ? . It was parodied by the Italian comedy film What Ever Happened to Baby Toto ? . The film was remade in 1991 as a television film starring real - life sisters Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave . Critical reception The film received positive reviews and elicited mixed responses over the Davis / Crawford combination . In his review in The New York Times , Bosley Crowther observed , \" [ Davis and Crawford ] do get off some amusing and eventually blood - chilling displays of screaming sororal hatred and general monstrousness ... The feeble attempts that Mr. Aldrich has made to suggest the irony of two once idolized and wealthy females living in such depravity , and the pathos of their deep - seated envy having brought them to this , wash out very quickly under the flood of sheer grotesquerie . \" Variety stated , \" Although the results heavily favor Davis ( and she earns the credit ) , it should be recognized that the plot , of necessity , allows her to run unfettered through all the stages of oncoming insanity ... Crawford gives a quiet , remarkably fine interpretation of the crippled Blanche , held in emotionally by the nature and temperament of the role . \" TV Guide awarded the film four stars , calling it \" Star wars , trenchantly served \" and adding , \" If it sometimes looks like a poisonous senior citizen show with over - the - top spoiled ham , just try to look away ... As in the best Hitchcock movies , suspense , rather than actual mayhem , drives the film . \"",

Based on the Broadway play of the same name by Philip Barry , the film is about a socialite whose wedding plans are complicated by the simultaneous arrival of her ex - husband and a tabloid magazine journalist . The socialite character of the play \u2013 performed by Hepburn in the film \u2013 was inspired by Helen Hope Montgomery Scott ( 1904 \u2013 1995 ) , a Philadelphia socialite known for her hijinks , who married a friend of playwright Barry . Written for the screen by Donald Ogden Stewart and an uncredited Waldo Salt , it is considered one of the best examples of a comedy of remarriage , a genre popular in the 1930s and 1940s , in which a couple divorce , flirt with outsiders and then remarry \u2013 a useful story - telling ploy at a time when the depiction of extramarital affairs was blocked by the Production Code . The film was Hepburn ' s first big hit following several flops , which had led to her being included on a 1938 list that Manhattan movie theater owner Harry Brandt compiled of actors considered to be \" box office poison . \" She acquired the film rights to the play , which she had also starred in , with the help of Howard Hughes , in order to control it as a vehicle for her screen comeback . According to a Turner Broadcasting documentary MGM : When the Lion Roars , after MGM purchased the film rights they were skeptical about Hepburn ' s box office appeal , so Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer ' s Louis B. Mayer took an unusual precaution by casting two A - list male stars ( Grant and Stewart ) to support Miss Hepburn . Nominated for six Academy Awards , the film won two ; James Stewart for Best Actor and Donald Ogden Stewart for Best Adapted Screenplay . It was remade in 1956 as a musical , retitled High Society . The Philadelphia Story was produced by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1995 . Plot Tracy Lord ( Katharine Hepburn ) is a wealthy Main Line Philadelphia socialite who had divorced C.K . Dexter Haven ( Cary Grant ) , a member of her social set , because he did not measure up to her exacting standards , due to his alcoholism and Tracy ' s lack of faith in him , which exacerbated his condition . She is about to marry nouveau riche \" man of the people \" George Kittredge ( John Howard ) .",

Forty years later , during the filming of On Golden Pond , Jane Fonda was frightened to do her own dive , to which the annoyed Hepburn responded , \" I did my own dive in The Philadelphia Story . \" The film premiered in New York City in the week of 27 December 1940 and it was shown in select theatres in December , but MGM had agreed to hold its general release until January 1941 in order not to compete with the stage play , which was no longer playing on Broadway , but was touring the country . It went into general American release on 17 January 1941 . It broke a box office record at Radio City Music Hall by taking in $ 600,000 in just six weeks . Reception Box office The film was the 5th most popular movie at the US box office in 1941 . According to MGM records it earned $ 2,374,000 in the US and Canada and $ 885,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $ 1,272,000 . Critical According to Bosley Crowther , the film \" has just about everything that a blue - chip comedy should have \u2013 a witty , romantic script derived by Donald Ogden Stewart out of Philip Barry ' s successful play ; the flavor of high - society elegance , in which the patrons invariably luxuriate , and a splendid cast of performers headed by Hepburn , Stewart and Grant . If it does n ' t play out this year and well along into next they should turn the Music Hall into a shooting gallery ... Metro and Director George Cukor have graciously made it apparent , in the words of a character , that one of ' the prettiest sights in this pretty world is the privileged classes enjoying their privileges . ' And so , in this instance , will you , too . \" The film has a 100 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 54 reviews , with an average rating of 8.8 / 10 . The consensus reads , \" Offering a wonderfully witty script , spotless direction from George Cukor , and typically excellent lead performances , The Philadelphia Story is an unqualified classic . \" The site also ranked it as the Best Romantic Comedy of all time . The film was the last of four starring Grant and Hepburn , the others being Sylvia Scarlett ( 1935 ) , Bringing Up Baby ( 1938 ) , and Holiday ( 1938 ) . All but Sylvia Scarlett belong to a subgenre of screwball comedy called the comedy of remarriage described by the philosopher Stanley Cavell as Hollywood ' s crowning achievement .",

Costarring with Hepburn on Broadway were Joseph Cotten as Dexter Haven , Van Heflin as Mike Connor , and Shirley Booth as Liz Imbrie . Hoping to create a film vehicle for herself which would erase the label of \" box office poison \" that the Independent Theatre Owners of America had put on her after a number of commercial failures ( including the classic Bringing Up Baby ) , Hepburn happily accepted the film rights to the play from Howard Hughes who had bought them for her . She then convinced MGM ' s Mayer to buy them from her for only $ 250,000 in return for Hepburn having veto over producer , director , screenwriter and cast . Hepburn selected director George Cukor , in whose films A Bill of Divorcement ( 1932 ) and Little Women ( 1933 ) she had acted , and Donald Ogden Stewart , a friend of Barry ' s and a specialist at adapting plays to the big screen , as writer . Hepburn wanted Clark Gable to play Dexter Haven and Spencer Tracy to play Mike Connor , but both had other commitments . Grant agreed to play the part on condition that he be given top billing and that his salary would be $ 137,000 , which he donated to the British War Relief Society . The pairing of Cukor and Gable would have been problematic in any case , as they had not gotten along on the recent Gone with the Wind , and Cukor had been replaced with Victor Fleming . The film was in production from 5 July to 14 August 1940 at MGM ' s studios in Culver City . It was shot in six weeks and came in five days under schedule.TCM [ http : / / www.tcm.com / tcmdb / title.jsp ? stid 12778 & category=Notes Notes ] At one point , Stewart slipped in his hiccuping during the drunk scene . Grant turned to him , surprised , and said \" Excuse me , \" then appears to stifle a laugh . The scene was kept and was not reshot . Stewart had been extremely nervous about the scene in which Connor recites poetry to Tracy and believed that he would perform badly . No\u00ebl Coward was visiting the set that day and was asked by Cukor to say something to encourage him . Stewart was also quite uncomfortable with some of the dialogue , especially in the swimming pool scene .",

McQueen is mentioned first in the film ' s trailers . In the cast list rolling from top to bottom at the film ' s end , however , McQueen and Newman ' s names were arranged diagonally as at the beginning ; as a consequence , Newman ' s name is fully visible first there . McQueen and Newman were promised the same pay and number of lines , which meant that one had to shoot additional scenes to equalize the dialog . Music The score was composed and conducted by John Williams , orchestrated by Herbert W. Spencer and Al Woodbury , and recorded at the 20th Century Fox scoring stage on October 31 and November 4 , 7 and 11 , 1974 . The original recording engineer was Ted Keep .

                    "context": "A snippet of a cue from Williams \u2019 score to Cinderella Liberty titled ' Maggie Shoots Pool ' is heard in a scene when William Holden ' s character converses on the phone with Paul Newman ' s character . It is not the recording on the soundtrack album but a newer arrangement recorded for The Towering Inferno . An extended version is heard , ostensibly as source music in a deleted theatrical scene sometimes shown as part of a longer scene from the TV broadcast version . One of the most sought - after unreleased music cues from the film is the one where Williams provides low - key lounge music during a party prior to the announcement of a fire . O \u2019 Halloran orders Duncan to evacuate the party ; the music becomes louder as Lisolette and Harlee are seen dancing and Duncan lectures son - in - law Roger . Titled \" The Promenade Room \" on the conductor ' s cue sheet , the track features a ragged ending as Duncan asks the house band to stop playing . Because of this , Film Score Monthly could not add this cue to the expanded soundtrack album . The Academy Award - winning song \" We May Never Love Like This Again \" was composed by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn and performed by Maureen McGovern , who appears in a cameo as a lounge singer and on the score ' s soundtrack album , which features the film recording plus the commercially released single version . Additionally , the theme tune is interpolated into the film ' s underscore by Williams . The song ' s writers collaborated on \" The Morning After \" from The Poseidon Adventure which was also sung by McGovern , although hers was not the vocal in that film . The first release of portions of the score from The Towering Inferno was on Warner Bros. Records early in 1975 ( Catalog No .

Ill - equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze , which soon spreads out of control . SFFD Chief Michael O ' Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor , directing them to express elevators . A guest , Lisolette Mueller , who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne , rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family . Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget . Duncan , aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey , directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe . Not heeding Duncan ' s directions , one last group takes an elevator to the ground , but are killed when it stops on the fire ' s floor . The fire also traps Bigelow and his secretary / mistress Lorrie in his 65th floor office , killing them . Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and the family from 87 . Jernigan gets the mother out safely but Roberts , Mueller and the two children are halted by a collapsed stairwell . They make a perilous climb down the stairs but fire forces them up to the Promenade Room . With fire suppression efforts becoming ineffective , the building loses electrical power and O ' Halloran ' s men are forced to rappel down an elevator shaft . A rooftop rescue results in disaster as guests rush the helicopter , causing it to crash , setting the roof ablaze and rendering further rooftop rescues impossible . Naval rescue teams attach a breeches buoy to the adjacent Peerless Building and rescue a number of guests , including Duncan ' s daughter , Simmons ' wife Patty . Roberts rigs a gravity brake on the external scenic elevator allowing twelve people , including Roberts ' girlfriend Susan , Mueller , and the children , one trip down . An explosion leaves the descending elevator hanging by a single cable at the 110th floor , where Mueller falls to her death . O ' Halloran and others save the rest . Simmons tells Duncan that he and others will use the breeches buoy next , but Duncan punches him , saying the rest will draw numbers but he and his son - in - law will be the last to leave . The fire reaches the Promenade Room and Simmons forces his way onto the buoy , leading to a struggle . Parker is pushed to his death by Simmons , who is killed by an explosion moments later .",

Although the album was not a re - recording , the original LP tracks were recorded during the same sessions and several cues were combined .

The musical was suggested by the classic novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes , but more directly based on Wasserman ' s 1959 non - musical television play , I , Don Quixote , which combines a semi - fictional episode from the life of Cervantes with scenes from his novel . The film was financed by an Italian production company , Produzioni Europee Associates , and shot in Rome . However , it is entirely in English , and all of its principal actors except for Sophia Loren are either British or American . ( Gino Conforti , who plays the Barber , is an American of Italian descent . ) The film was released by United Artists . It is known in Italy as L ' Uomo della Mancha . The film was produced and directed by Arthur Hiller , and stars Peter O ' Toole as both Miguel de Cervantes and Don Quixote , James Coco as both Cervantes ' Manservant and Don Quixote ' s \" squire \" Sancho Panza , and Sophia Loren as scullery maid and prostitute Aldonza , whom the delusional Don Quixote idolizes as Dulcinea . Gillian Lynne , who later choreographed Cats , staged the choreography for the film ( including the fight scenes ) . Gino Conforti , as the barber , is the only member of the original Broadway musical cast to repeat his role for the film . Plot Cervantes and his manservant have been imprisoned by the Spanish Inquisition , and a manuscript by Cervantes is seized by his fellow inmates , who subject him to a mock trial in order to determine whether the manuscript should be returned . Cervantes ' defense is in the form of a play , in which Cervantes takes the role of Alonso Quijana , an old gentleman who has lost his mind and now believes that he should go forth as a knight - errant . Quijano renames himself Don Quixote de La Mancha , and sets out to find adventures with his \" squire \" , Sancho Panza .

Cobb , Colleen Dewhurst ( who replaced Viveca Lindfors ) , and Eli Wallach , and was not performed on a thrust stage , but on a television sound stage . The DuPont Corporation disliked the title Man of La Mancha , thinking that its viewing audience would not know what La Mancha actually meant , so a new title , I , Don Quixote , was chosen . The play was broadcast live on November 9 , 1959 , with an estimated audience of 20 million . Unfortunately , due to the production being staged in the early days of videotape , and due to the inferiority of kinescopes , no footage of this production survives . Years after this television broadcast , and after the original teleplay had been unsuccessfully optioned as a non - musical Broadway play , director Albert Marre called Wasserman and suggested that he turn his play into a musical . Mitch Leigh was selected as composer , with orchestrations by Carlyle W. Hall . Unusually for the time , the show was scored for an orchestra with no violins or other traditional orchestral stringed instruments apart from a double bass , instead making heavier use of brass , woodwinds , percussion and utilizing flamenco guitars as the only stringed instruments of any sort . The original lyricist of the musical was poet W. H. Auden , but his lyrics were discarded , some of them considered too overtly satiric and biting , attacking the bourgeois audience at times . Auden ' s lyrics were replaced by those of Joe Darion . Productions The musical first played at the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut in 1965 . Rex Harrison was to be the original star of this production , but although Harrison had starred in a musical role in the stage and film versions of My Fair Lady , the musical demands of the role of Don Quixote were too heavy for him . After 21 previews , the musical opened at the experimental thrust - stage ANTA Washington Square Theatre in Greenwich Village on November 22 , 1965 . The show moved uptown to the Martin Beck Theatre on March 20 , 1968 , then to the Eden Theatre on March 3 , 1971 , and finally to the Mark Hellinger Theatre on May 26 , 1971 for its last month , a total original New York run of 2,329 performances . Musical staging and direction were by Albert Marre , choreography was by Jack Cole , and Howard Bay was the scenic and lighting designer , with costumes by Bay and Patton Campbell .",

Previously , it has been proven by the success of films like Gone With the Wind , The Wizard of Oz and Laura that a change in directors or actors need not affect the response to a film negatively . Upon release , and for several years afterward , the film of Man of La Mancha received overwhelmingly negative reviews , notably from Time Magazine , which not only did not consider the film worthy of a full - length review , but even threw in some criticism of the original stage production into the bargain . They referred to the film as being \" epically vulgar \" , and called the song The Impossible Dream \" surely the most mercilessly lachrymose hymn to empty - headed optimism since Carousels \" You ' ll Never Walk Alone . \" Newsweek , in its review , opined that \" the whole production is basted in the cheapest sentiment . Everyone gets a chance to cry over poor Don Quixote \" . Leonard Maltin still gives the film a BOMB rating in his annual Movie and Video Guide , stating \" Beautiful source material has been raped , murdered and buried \" . Roger Ebert , who gave the film two stars , stated : \" Now it ' s almost obligatory to cast a musical with people who ca n ' t sing or dance \u2013 and make no pretensions to . At least when we were getting Natalie Wood , we were getting Marni Nixon|Marnie [ sic ] Nixon ' s voice . If there ' s anything worse than dubbing in the voice of a non - singer , its not dubbing the voice of a non - singer . \" Mistakenly assuming that Peter O ' Toole sang his own songs in the film , Ebert went on : \" What favor were they doing us when they let us hear Peter O ' Toole sing ? Richard Harris is better , and he ' s no good . He ca n ' t sing , that is , but at least he can read lyrics . O ' Toole masticates them . \"",

The decision to cast Redgrave as F\u00e9nelon was , however , a source of controversy . In light of Redgrave ' s support for the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , even F\u00e9nelon objected to her casting . Redgrave was perplexed by such hostility , stating in her 1991 autobiography her long - held belief that \" the struggle against antisemitism and for the self - determination of the Palestinians form a single whole . \" In 1984 , Redgrave sued the Boston Symphony Orchestra , claiming that the orchestra had fired her from a performance because of her support of the PLO . Lillian Hellman testified in court on Redgrave ' s behalf . Redgrave won on a count of breach of contract , but did not win on the claim that the Boston orchestra had violated her civil rights by firing her . In 1995 , Redgrave was elected to serve as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador . In December 2002 , Redgrave paid \u00a3 50,000 bail for Chechen separatist Deputy Premier and special envoy Akhmed Zakayev , who had sought political asylum in the United Kingdom and was accused by the Russian government of aiding and abetting hostage - takings in the Moscow Hostage Crisis of 2002 and guerrilla warfare against Russia . At a press conference Redgrave said she feared for Zakayev ' s safety if he were extradited to Russia on terrorism charges . He would \" die of a heart attack \" or some other mysterious explanation offered by Russia , she said . On 13 November 2003 , a London court rejected the Russian government ' s request for Zakayev ' s extradition . Instead , the court accepted a plea by lawyers for Zakayev that he would not get a fair trial , and could even face torture , in Russia . \" It would be unjust and oppressive to return Mr Zakayev to Russia , \" Judge Timothy Workman ruled . In 2004 , Vanessa Redgrave and her brother Corin Redgrave launched the Peace and Progress Party , which campaigned against the Iraq War and for human rights . However , in June 2005 Redgrave left the party .",

Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent ' s court . The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as \" lawn tennis \" . It had close connections both to various field ( \" lawn \" ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport of real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term \" tennis \" referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis : for example , in Disraeli ' s novel Sybil ( 1845 ) , Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will \" go down to Hampton Court and play tennis . \" The rules of tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point . Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport . The four Grand Slam tournaments ( also referred to as the \" Majors \" ) are especially popular : the Australian Open played on hard courts , the French Open played on red clay courts , Wimbledon played on grass courts , and the US Open played also on hard courts .

Evans , turfgrass agronomist , \" Sports historians all agree that [ Wingfield ] deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis . \" According to Honor Godfrey , museum curator at Wimbledon , Wingfield \" popularized this game enormously . He produced a boxed set which included a net , poles , rackets , balls for playing the game - - and most importantly you had his rules . He was absolutely terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world . He had very good connections with the clergy , the law profession , and the aristocracy and he sent thousands of sets out in the first year or so , in 1874 . \" The world ' s oldest tennis tournament , the Wimbledon Championships , were first played in London in 1877 .

                    "context": "Historians believe that the game ' s ancient origin lay in 12th century northern France , where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand . Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume ( \" game of the palm \" ) , which evolved into real tennis , and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style . Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor , enclosed courts made in Paris \" around the end of the 13th century \" . In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe . In June 1316 at Vincennes , Val - de - Marne and following a particularly exhausting game , Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy , although there was also suspicion of poisoning . Because of the contemporary accounts of his death , Louis X is history ' s first tennis player known by name . Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King Charles V of France , who had a court set up at the Louvre Palace . It was n ' t until the 16th century that rackets came into use , and the game began to be called \" tennis \" , from the Old French term tenez , which can be translated as \" hold ! \" , \" receive ! \" or \" take ! \" , an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent . It was popular in England and France , although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall . Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game , which is now known as real tennis . During the 18th century and early 19th century , as real tennis declined , new racket sports emerged in England . Further , the patenting of the first lawn mower in 1830 , in Britain , is strongly believed to have been the catalyst , world - wide , for the preparation of modern - style grass courts , sporting ovals , playing fields , pitches , greens , etc . This in turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports , including lawn tennis , most football codes , lawn bowls and others . Origins of the modern game",

                    "context": "The Davis Cup , an annual competition between men ' s national teams , dates to 1900 . The analogous competition for women ' s national teams , the Fed Cup , was founded as the Federation Cup in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the ITF . In 1926 , promoter C. C. Pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences . The most notable of these early professionals were the American Vinnie Richards and the Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen . Once a player turned pro he or she could not compete in the major ( amateur ) tournaments . In 1968 , commercial pressures and rumors of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction , inaugurating the Open Era , in which all players could compete in all tournaments , and top players were able to make their living from tennis . With the beginning of the Open Era , the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit , and revenues from the sale of television rights , tennis ' s popularity has spread worldwide , and the sport has shed its middle - class English - speaking image ( although it is acknowledged that this stereotype still exists ) . In 1954 , Van Alen founded the International Tennis Hall of Fame , a non - profit museum in Newport , Rhode Island . The building contains a large collection of tennis memorabilia as well as a hall of fame honouring prominent members and tennis players from all over the world . Each year , a grass court tournament and an induction ceremony honoring new Hall of Fame members are hosted on its grounds . Equipment Part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play . Beginners need only a racket and balls . Rackets The components of a tennis racket include a handle , known as the grip , connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings . For the first 100 years of the modern game , rackets were made of wood and of standard size , and strings were of animal gut . Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite , ceramics , and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced . These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power . Meanwhile , technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability .",

She became fascinated by the game of tennis after watching British army officers play . She laid out a tennis court at the Staten Island Cricket Club at Camp Washington , Tompkinsville , Staten Island , New York . The first American National championship was played there in September 1880 . An Englishman named O.E Woodhouse won the singles title , and a silver cup worth $ 100 , by defeating Canadian I. F. Hellmuth . There was also a doubles match which was won by a local pair . There were different rules at each club . The ball in Boston was larger than the one normally used in New York . On 21 May 1881 , the United States National Lawn Tennis Association ( now the United States Tennis Association ) was formed to standardize the rules and organize competitions . The U.S. National Men ' s Singles Championship , now the US Open , was first held in 1881 at the Newport Casino , Newport , Rhode Island . The U.S. National Women ' s Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia . Tennis also became popular in France , where the French Championships dates to 1891 although until 1925 it was open only to tennis players who were members of French clubs . Thus , Wimbledon , the US Open , the French Open , and the Australian Open ( dating to 1905 ) became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis . Together these four events are called the Majors or Slams ( a term borrowed from bridge rather than baseball ) . The comprehensive rules promulgated in 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation , now known as the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) , have remained largely stable in the ensuing eighty years , the one major change being the addition of the tiebreak system designed by Jimmy Van Alen . That same year , tennis withdrew from the Olympics after the 1924 Games but returned 60 years later as a 21 - and - under demonstration event in 1984 . This reinstatement was credited by the efforts by the then ITF President Philippe Chatrier , ITF General Secretary David Gray and ITF Vice President Pablo Llorens , and support from IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch . The success of the event was overwhelming and the IOC decided to reintroduce tennis as a full medal sport at Seoul in 1988 .",

Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls . A net is stretched across the full width of the court , parallel with the baselines , dividing it into two equal ends . It is held up by either a metal cable or cord that can be no more than 0.8 cm ( 1 / 3 inch ) . The net is 3 feet 6 inches ( 1.067 m ) high at the posts and 3 feet ( 0.914 m ) high in the center . The net posts are 3 feet ( 0.914 m ) outside the doubles court on each side or , for a singles net , 3 feet ( 0.914 m ) outside the singles court on each side . The modern tennis court owes its design to Major Walter Clopton Wingfield who , in 1873 , patented a court much the same as the current one for his stick\u00e9 tennis ( sphairistike ) . This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today , with markings similar to Wingfield ' s version , but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle . Tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces . Grass , clay , and hardcourts of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common . Occasionally carpet is used for indoor play , with hardwood flooring having been historically used . Artificial turf courts can also be found . Lines",

His wife , Michelle Martin , was convicted as an accomplice . Dutroux was also convicted of having killed a suspected former accomplice , Bernard Weinstein . He was arrested in 1996 and has been in prison ever since , though he briefly escaped in April 1998 . Earlier , in 1989 , Dutroux and Martin had been sentenced to 13 and a half and 5 years imprisonment , respectively , for the abduction and rape of five young girls , the youngest of whom being eleven years old . Dutroux was released after serving three years . Dutroux ' s widely publicised trial took place in 2004 . A number of shortcomings in the Dutroux investigation caused widespread discontent in Belgium with the country ' s criminal justice system , and the ensuing scandal was one of the reasons for the reorganisation of Belgium ' s law enforcement agencies . Early life Born in Ixelles , Belgium , on 6 November 1956 , Dutroux was the oldest of five children .

Michel Nihoul was later acquitted from the charge of being an offender on kidnapping and murder of the girls by the court . The jury was asked to go back into seclusion to decide whether or not Michel Nihoul was an accomplice . On 23 June , Dutroux lodged an appeal against his sentence . Dutroux is currently being held in solitary confinement at Nivelles Prison . Although Michel Nihoul was acquitted of kidnapping and conspiracy charges , he was convicted on drug - related charges and received five years . On 19 August 2012 about 2,000 demonstrators in Brussels demonstrated against Michelle Martin ' s possible early release from prison . She has since been released , 13 years into her sentence . On 4 February 2013 , Dutroux requested to a court in Brussels for an early release from prison . He insisted that he was \" no longer dangerous \" and wanted to be released into house arrest with an electronic tag placed upon him . On 18 February , the court denied the request . Legacy The Dutroux case is so infamous that more than a third of Belgians with the surname \" Dutroux \" applied to have their name changed between 1996 and 1998 . Dutroux ' s houses Marc Dutroux owned seven houses , four of which he used for his kidnappings : *The house on the Route de Philippeville 128 in Marcinelle is most often cited in the media . All girls were held captive here in the basement and bedroom.The municipality of Charleroi seized ownership of this house , because of what happened there and the bad state of the house . There are plans to create an open space with a memorial site here . In the Belgian procedure of compulsory purchase , an owner has a last right to visit a house . Therefore , Dutroux visited this house on 10 September 2009 , under heavy police guard . *A house in Jumet , that has since been demolished . An and Eefje were buried in the garden of this house by Dutroux . Weinstein lived in this house for a while . A small monument is placed at this location . *A house in Marchienne - au - Pont . Julie and M\u00e9lissa were held captive here for a short while after their kidnapping . *A house in Sars - la - Buissi\u00e8re . Julie , M\u00e9lissa and Bernard Weinstein were buried here after Dutroux killed them . The house was bought by the municipality of Lobbes in the first months of 2009 . It is planned to make a park with a monument commemorating the victims of Dutroux here .",

In April 1989 , Dutroux was sentenced to thirteen and a half years in prison . Martin received a sentence of five years . Showing good behaviour in prison , Dutroux was released on parole in April 1992 , having served only three years , by Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet . Upon his release the parole board received a letter from Dutroux ' s own mother to the prison director , in which she stressed concern that he was keeping young girls captive in his house \u2013 which was essentially ignored . Following his release from prison , Dutroux convinced a psychiatrist that he was psychiatrically disabled , resulting in a government pension . He also received prescriptions of sleeping pills and sedatives , which he would later use on his victims . Abductions after arrest Julie Lejeune and M\u00e9lissa Russo ( both aged eight ) were kidnapped together from Gr\u00e2ce - Hollogne on 24 June 1995 , probably by Dutroux , and imprisoned in Dutroux ' s cellar . Dutroux repeatedly sexually abused the girls and produced pornographic videos of the abuse . On 22 August 1995 , Dutroux kidnapped 17 - year - old An Marchal and 19 - year - old Eefje Lambrecks who were on a camping trip in Ostend . He was probably assisted by his accomplice Michel Leli\u00e8vre , who was paid with drugs . Since the dungeon already contained Lejeune and Russo , Dutroux chained the girls to a bed in a room of his house . His wife was aware of all these activities . Second arrest In late 1995 , Dutroux was arrested by police for involvement in a stolen luxury car racket . He was held in custody for three months between 6 December 1995 and 20 March 1996 . Police searched Dutroux ' s house on 13 December 1995 and again six days later in relation to the car theft charge . During this time , Julie Lejeune and M\u00e9lissa Russo were still alive in the basement dungeon , but in spite of their cries being heard , police failed to discover them . Michelle Martin allegedly fed her husband ' s German shepherd dogs but did not follow his orders to feed the girls , later claiming she was too afraid to go into the dungeon . Lejeune and Russo starved to death , and were later buried in bin bags in the back garden .",

Several incidents suggest that despite several warnings to the authorities , Dutroux ' s intentions were not properly followed - up . Dutroux had offered money to a police informant to provide him with girls , and told him that he was constructing a cell in his basement . His mother also wrote a second letter to the police , claiming that he held girls captive in his houses . Dutroux was actually under police camera surveillance the night he kidnapped Marchal and Lambrecks , the police had only programmed the camera to operate during the daylight hours of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m . Perhaps most notably , the police search of Dutroux ' s house on 13 December 1995 and again six days later in relation to his car theft charge , came under harshest scrutiny . During this time , Julie Lejeune and M\u00e9lissa Russo were still alive in the basement dungeon , but the police failed to discover them . Since the search was unrelated to kidnapping charges , police searching the house had no dogs or specialised equipment that might have discovered the girls ' presence , and in an otherwise decrepit and dirty basement they failed to recognize the significance of the freshly plastered and painted wall that concealed the dungeon . While in the basement , a locksmith who was accompanying the police said he heard children ' s cries coming from inside the house , but was overruled by the police , who concluded the cries must have come from the street outside . This was especially remarkable since the country was at that time in the midst of a nationwide search for missing children . Several videotapes were also seized from the house that showed Dutroux constructing the secret entrance and the dungeon where the girls were then held . The tapes were never viewed by the police , who later claimed this was because they did not have a videotape player . Allegations of cover - up",

Third arrest and discovery of the crimes On 9 August 1996 , Dutroux and Leli\u00e8vre kidnapped 14 - year - old Laetitia Delhez as she was walking home from a public swimming pool . An eyewitness had earlier observed Dutroux ' s van , described it and identified part of the license plate . Dutroux , his wife , and Leli\u00e8vre were all arrested on 13 August 1996 . An initial search of his houses proved inconclusive , but two days later , Dutroux and Leli\u00e8vre both made confessions . Dutroux led the police to the basement dungeon where Dardenne and Delhez were found alive on 15 August 1996 .

Dutroux said he saved her , and that he was not one of the gang members she should fear . He let her write letters to her family , which he read but never sent .

While being transferred to a court house without handcuffs , Dutroux overpowered one of his guards , took his gun and escaped . Police in his native Belgium , and in France , Luxembourg and Germany placed their police forces on an \" all - borders alert \" along with a major manhunt . He was caught a few hours later . The Minister of Justice Stefaan De Clerck , the Minister of the Interior Johan Vande Lanotte , and the police chief resigned as a result . In 2000 , Dutroux received a five - year sentence for threatening a police officer during his escape . In 2002 , he received another five - year sentence for unrelated crimes . Trial Dutroux ' s trial began on 1 March 2004 , some seven and a half years after his initial arrest . It was a trial by jury and up to 450 people were called upon to testify . The trial took place in Arlon , the capital of the Belgian province of Luxembourg , where the investigations had started . Dutroux was tried for the murder of An Marchal , Eefje Lambrecks and Bernard Weinstein , a suspected accomplice . While admitting the abductions , he denied all three killings , although he had earlier confessed to killing Weinstein . Dutroux was also charged with a host of other crimes : auto theft , abduction , attempted murder and attempted abduction , molestation , and three unrelated rapes of women from Slovakia . Martin was tried as an accomplice , as were Leli\u00e8vre and . To protect the accused , they were made to sit in a glass cage during the trial . In the first week of the trial , photos of Dutroux ' s face were not allowed to be printed in Belgian newspapers for privacy reasons ; this ban remained in force until March 9 . Throughout the trial , Dutroux continued to insist that he was part of a Europe - wide paedophile ring with accomplices among police officers , businessmen , doctors , and even high - level Belgian politicians . In a rare move , the jury at the Assize trial publicly protested the presiding judge St\u00e9phane Goux ' s handling of the debates and the victims ' testimonies . On 14 June 2004 , after three months of trial , the jury went into seclusion to reach their verdicts on Dutroux and the three other accused . Verdicts were returned on 17 June 2004 after three days of deliberation . Dutroux , Martin and Leli\u00e8vre were found guilty on all charges ; the jury were unable to reach a verdict on Michel Nihoul ' s role . Sentencing",

It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30 , 1935 , by President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers , and cost over one hundred lives . The dam was controversially named after President Herbert Hoover . Since about 1900 , the Black Canyon and nearby Boulder Canyon had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods , provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power . In 1928 , Congress authorized the project . The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies , Inc. , which began construction on the dam in early 1931 . Such a large concrete structure had never been built before , and some of the techniques were unproven . The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties . Nevertheless , Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on March 1 , 1936 , more than two years ahead of schedule . Hoover Dam impounds Lake Mead , the largest reservoir in the United States by volume ( when it is full ) . The dam is located near Boulder City , Nevada , a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project , about southeast of Las Vegas , Nevada . The dam ' s generators provide power for public and private utilities in Nevada , Arizona , and California . Hoover Dam is a major tourist attraction ; nearly a million people tour the dam each year . The heavily travelled U.S. 93 ran along the dam ' s crest until October 2010 , when the Hoover Dam Bypass opened . Background Search for resources",

An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s , when land speculator William Beatty built the Alamo Canal just north of the Mexican border ; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the Imperial Valley . Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley , the canal proved expensive to maintain . After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the Salton Sea , the Southern Pacific Railroad spent $ 3 million in 1906 \u2013 07 to stabilize the waterway , an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the Federal Government . Even after the waterway was stabilized , it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border . As the technology of electric power transmission improved , the Lower Colorado was considered for its hydroelectric - power potential . In 1902 , the Edison Electric Company of Los Angeles surveyed the river in the hope of building a 40 ft rock dam which could generate . However , at the time , the limit of transmission of electric power was 80 mi , and there were few customers ( mostly mines ) within that limit . Edison allowed land options it held on the river to lapse \u2013 including an option for what became the site of Hoover Dam . In the following years , the Bureau of Reclamation ( BOR ) , known as the Reclamation Service at the time , also considered the Lower Colorado as the site for a dam . Service chief Arthur Powell Davis proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of Boulder Canyon , 20 mi north of the eventual dam site , into the river . The river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris , and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble . In 1922 , after considering it for several years , the Reclamation Service finally rejected the proposal , citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would in fact save money .

The 1927 Mississippi flood made Midwestern and Southern congressmen and senators more sympathetic toward the dam project . On March 12 , 1928 , the failure of the St. Francis Dam , constructed by the city of Los Angeles , caused a disastrous flood that killed up to 600 people . As that dam was a curved - gravity type , similar in design to the arch - gravity as was proposed for the Black Canyon dam , opponents claimed that the Black Canyon dam ' s safety could not be guaranteed . Congress authorized a board of engineers to review plans for the proposed dam . The Colorado River Board found the project feasible , but warned that should the dam fail , every downstream Colorado River community would be destroyed , and that the river might change course and empty into the Salton Sea . The Board cautioned : \" To avoid such possibilities , the proposed dam should be constructed on conservative if not ultra - conservative lines . \" On December 21 , 1928 President Coolidge signed the bill authorizing the dam . The Boulder Canyon Project Act appropriated $ 165 million for the Hoover Dam along with the downstream Imperial Dam and All - American Canal , a replacement for Beatty ' s canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border . It also permitted the compact to go into effect when at least six of the seven states approved it . This occurred on March 6 , 1929 with Utah ' s ratification ; Arizona did not approve it until 1944 . Design , preparation and contracting Even before Congress approved the Boulder Canyon Project , the Bureau of Reclamation was considering what kind of dam should be used . Officials eventually decided on a massive concrete arch - gravity dam , the design of which was overseen by the Bureau ' s chief design engineer John L. Savage . The monolithic dam would be thick at the bottom and thin near the top , and would present a convex face towards the water above the dam . The curving arch of the dam would transmit the water ' s force into the abutments , in this case the rock walls of the canyon . The wedge - shaped dam would be thick at the bottom , narrowing to at the top , leaving room for a highway connecting Nevada and Arizona .",

The report was principally authored by Davis , and was called the Fall - Davis report after Interior Secretary Albert Fall . The Fall - Davis report cited use of the Colorado River as a federal concern , because the river ' s basin covered several states , and the river eventually entered Mexico . Though the Fall - Davis report called for a dam \" at or near Boulder Canyon \" , the Reclamation Service ( which was renamed the Bureau of Reclamation the following year ) found that canyon unsuitable . One potential site at Boulder Canyon was bisected by a geologic fault ; two others were so narrow there was no space for a construction camp at the bottom of the canyon or for a spillway . The Service investigated Black Canyon and found it ideal ; a railway could be laid from the railhead in Las Vegas to the top of the dam site . Despite the site change , the dam project was referred to as the \" Boulder Canyon Project \" . With little guidance on water allocation from the Supreme Court , proponents of the dam feared endless litigation . A Colorado attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river ' s basin ( California , Nevada , Arizona , Utah , New Mexico , Colorado and Wyoming ) form an interstate compact , with the approval of Congress . Such compacts were authorized by Article I of the United States Constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states . In 1922 , representatives of seven states met with then - Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover . Initial talks produced no result , but when the Supreme Court handed down the Wyoming v. Colorado decision undermining the claims of the upstream states , they became anxious to reach an agreement . The resulting Colorado River Compact was signed on November 24 , 1922 .",

The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 ( BCPA ) never mentioned a proposed name or title for the dam . The BCPA merely allows the government to \" construct , operate , and maintain a dam and incidental works in the main stream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon \" . When Secretary Wilbur spoke at the ceremony starting the building of the railway between Las Vegas and the dam site on September 17 , 1930 , he named the dam \" Hoover Dam \" , citing a tradition of naming dams after Presidents , though none had been so honored during their terms of office . Wilbur justified his choice on the ground that Hoover was \" the great engineer whose vision and persistence ... has done so much to make [ the dam ] possible \" . One writer complained in response that \" the Great Engineer had quickly drained , ditched , and dammed the country . \" After Hoover ' s election defeat in 1932 and the accession of the Roosevelt administration , Secretary Ickes ordered on May 13 , 1933 that the dam be referred to as \" Boulder Dam \" . Ickes stated that Wilbur had been imprudent in naming the dam after a sitting president , that Congress had never ratified his choice , and that it had long been referred to as Boulder Dam . Unknown to the general public , Attorney General Homer Cummings informed Ickes that Congress had indeed used the name \" Hoover Dam \" in five different bills appropriating money for construction of the dam . The official status this conferred to the name \" Hoover Dam \" had been noted on the floor of the House of Representatives by Congressman Edward T. Taylor of Colorado on December 12 , 1930 , but was likewise ignored by Ickes .",

Las Vegas , then a small city of some 5,000 , saw between 10,000 and 20,000 unemployed descend on it . A government camp was established for surveyors and other personnel near the dam site ; this soon became surrounded by a squatters ' camp . Known as McKeeversville , the camp was home to men hoping for work on the project , together with their families . Another camp , on the flats along the Colorado River , was officially called Williamsville , but was known to its inhabitants as \" Ragtown \" . When construction began , Six Companies hired large numbers of workers , with more than 3,000 on the payroll by 1932 and with employment peaking at 5,251 in July 1934 . \" Mongolian \" ( Chinese ) labor was prevented by the construction contract , while the number of blacks employed by Six Companies never exceeded thirty , mostly lowest - pay - scale laborers in a segregated crew , who were issued separate water buckets . As part of the contract , Six Companies , Inc. was to build Boulder City to house the workers . The original timetable called for Boulder City to be built before the dam project began , but President Hoover ordered work on the dam to begin in March 1931 rather than in October . The company built bunkhouses , attached to the canyon wall , to house 480 single men at what became known as River Camp . Workers with families were left to provide their own accommodations until Boulder City could be completed , and many lived in Ragtown . The site of Hoover Dam endures extremely hot weather , and the summer of 1931 was especially torrid , with the daytime high averaging . Sixteen workers and other riverbank residents died of heat prostration between June 25 and July 26 , 1931 .",

Today , nearly a million people per year take the tours of the dam offered by the Bureau of Reclamation . Increased security concerns by the government have led to most of the interior structure being inaccessible to tourists . As a result , few of True ' s decorations can now be seen by visitors . Environmental impact The changes in water flow and use caused by Hoover Dam ' s construction and operation have had a large impact on the Colorado River Delta . The construction of the dam has been credited as causing the decline of this estuarine ecosystem . For six years after the construction of the dam , while Lake Mead filled , virtually no water reached the mouth of the river . The delta ' s estuary , which once had a freshwater - saltwater mixing zone stretching 40 mi south of the river ' s mouth , was turned into an inverse estuary where the level of salinity was higher close to the river ' s mouth . The Colorado River had experienced natural flooding before the construction of the Hoover Dam . The dam eliminated the natural flooding , which threatened many species adapted to the flooding , including both plants and animals . The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam . Four species of fish native to the Colorado River , the Bonytail chub , Colorado pikeminnow , Humpback chub , and Razorback sucker , are listed as endangered . Naming controversy",

( There are some references throughout major league history books to the team being called the \" Worcester Brown Stockings \" , \" Brownies \" , and \" Ruby Legs \" . However , the Worcester Telegram sportswriter Bill Ballou , in conducting thorough research on the team for years , has found no contemporary reference to any of those nicknames . ) The team ' s home field , the Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds was the site of the first recorded perfect game in professional baseball .

Named after Worcester , England , as of the 2010 Census the city ' s population was 181,045 , making it the second largest city in New England after Boston . Worcester is located approximately 40 mi west of Boston , and 50 mi east of Springfield . Due to its location in Central Massachusetts , amidst Massachusetts ' major metropolitan regions , Worcester is known as the \" Heart of the Commonwealth \" , thus , a heart is the official symbol of the city . However , the heart symbol may also have its provenance in lore that Valentine ' s Day cards were invented in the city . Worcester was considered its own region for centuries ; however , with the encroachment of Boston ' s suburbs in the 1970s after the construction of Interstate 495 and Interstate 290 , it now marks the western periphery of the Boston - Worcester - Providence ( MA - RI - NH ) U.S. Census Combined Statistical Area ( CSA ) , or Greater Boston . The city features many examples of Victorian - era mill architecture . History The area was first inhabited by members of the Nipmuc tribe . The native people called the region Quinsigamond and built a settlement on Pakachoag Hill in Auburn . In 1673 English settlers John Eliot and Daniel Gookin led an expedition to Quinsigamond to establish a new Christian Indian \" praying town \" and identify a new location for an English settlement . On July 13 , 1674 , Gookin obtained a deed to eight square miles of land in Quinsigamond from the Nipmuc people and English traders and settlers began to inhabit the region . In 1675 , King Philip ' s War broke out throughout New England with the Nipmuc Indians coming to the aid of Indian leader King Philip . The English settlers completely abandoned the Quinsigamond area and the empty buildings were burned by the Indian forces . The town was again abandoned during Queen Anne ' s War in 1702 . Finally in 1713 , Worcester was permanently resettled for a third time by Jonas Rice . Named after the city of Worcester , England , the town was incorporated on June 14 , 1722 . On April 2 , 1731 , Worcester was chosen as the county seat of the newly founded Worcester County government . Between 1755 and 1758 , future U.S. president John Adams worked as a schoolteacher and studied law in Worcester .",

Thomas would continuously publish his paper throughout the American Revolutionary War . On July 14 , 1776 , Thomas performed the first public reading in Massachusetts of the Declaration of Independence in front of the Worcester town hall . He would later go on to form the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester in 1812 . During the turn of the 19th century Worcester ' s economy moved into manufacturing . Factories producing textiles , shoes and clothing opened along the nearby Blackstone River . However , the manufacturing industry in Worcester would not begin to thrive until the opening of the Blackstone Canal in 1828 and the opening of the Worcester and Boston Railroad in 1835 . The city transformed into a transportation hub and the manufacturing industry flourished . Worcester was officially chartered as a city on February 29 , 1848 . The city ' s industries soon attracted immigrants of primarily Irish , French , and Swedish descent in the mid - 19th century and later many immigrants of Lithuanian , Polish , Italian , Greek , Turkish and Armenian descent . Immigrants moved into new triple - decker houses which lined hundreds of Worcester ' s expanding streets and neighborhoods . In 1831 Ichabod Washburn opened the Washburn & Moen Company . The company would become the largest wire manufacturing in the country and Washburn became one of the leading industrial and philanthropic figures in the city .

Leading various groups called \" The Herd \" , Herman was one of the most popular of the 1930s and 1940s bandleaders . His bands often played music that was experimental for its time . He was a featured halftime performer for Super Bowl VII . Early life and career Herman was born Woodrow Charles Thomas Herman in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , on May 16 , 1913 . His parents were Otto and Myrtle ( Bartoszewicz ) Herman . His mother was Polish . His father had a deep love for show business and this influenced Woody Herman at an early age . As a child he worked as a singer and tap - dancer in Vaudeville , then started to play the clarinet and saxophone by age 12 . In 1931 , he met Charlotte Neste , an aspiring actress ; they married on September 27 , 1936 . Woody Herman joined the Tom Gerun band and his first recorded vocals were \" Lonesome Me \" and \" My Heart ' s at Ease \" . Herman also performed with the Harry Sosnick orchestra , Gus Arnheim and Isham Jones . Isham Jones wrote many popular songs , including \" It Had to Be You \" and at some point was tiring of the demands of leading a band . Jones wanted to live off the residuals of his songs ; Woody Herman saw the chance to lead his former band , and eventually acquired the remains of the orchestra after Jones ' retirement .

Despite the Carnegie Hall success and other triumphs , Herman was forced to disband the orchestra in 1946 at the height of its success . This was his only financially successful band ; he left it to spend more time with his wife and family . During this time , he and his family had just moved into the former Hollywood home of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall . One reason Herman may have disbanded was his wife Charlotte ' s growing problems with alcoholism and pill addiction . Charlotte Herman joined Alcoholics Anonymous and gave up everything she was addicted to . Woody said , laughing , \" I went to an AA meeting with Charlotte and my old band was sitting there . \" Many critics cite December 1946 as the actual date the big - band era ended , when seven other bands , in addition to Herman ' s , dissolved .

In January 1937 George T.

Musicians and arrangers that stand out include Cappy Lewis on trumpet and Dean Kincaide , a big band arranger . In jazz , swing was gradually being replaced by bebop . Dizzy Gillespie , a trumpeter and one of the originators of bop , wrote three arrangements for Woody Herman , \" Woody ' n You \" , \" Swing Shift \" and \" Down Under \" . These were arranged in 1942 . \" Woody ' n You \" was not used at the time . \" Down Under \" was recorded November 8 , 1943 .

Herman owed the IRS millions of dollars and was in danger of eviction from his home . With this added stress , Herman still kept performing . In a December 5 , 1985 , review of the band at the Blue Note jazz club for The New York Times , John S. Wilson pointed out : \" In a one - hour set , Mr. Herman is able to show off his latest batch of young stars \u2013 the baritone saxophonist Mike Brignola , the bassist Bill Moring , the pianist Brad Williams , the trumpeter Ron Stout \u2013 and to remind listeners that one of his own basic charms is the dry humor with which he shouts the blues . \" Wilson also spoke about arrangements by Bill Holman and John Fedchock for special attention . Wilson spoke of the continuing influence of Duke Ellington on Woody Herman bands from the nineteen forties to the nineteen eighties . In 1986 , from December 21 \u2013 23 , about ten months prior to his death , Herman was a guest at a friend ' s house in Iowa City , Iowa . An engraved marker was inlaid next to the driveway of the location at 820 Brown Street to commemorate the occasion . Before Woody Herman died in 1987 he delegated most of his duties to leader of the reed section , Frank Tiberi . Tiberi leads the current version of the Woody Herman orchestra . Tiberi said at the time of Herman ' s death that he would not change the band ' s repertoire or library . Herman had a Catholic funeral on November 2 , 1987 , at St. Victor ' s in West Hollywood , California . He is interred in a niche in the columbarium behind the Cathedral Mausoleum in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery . Concord Music Group ' s website mentions these awards won by the various Woody Herman orchestras : \" Voted best swing band in 1945 Down Beat poll ; Silver Award by critics in 1946 and 1947 Esquire polls ; won Metronome poll , band division , 1946 and 1953 ; won NARAS Grammy Award for Encore as best big band jazz album of 1963 ; won NARAS Grammy Award for Giant Steps as best big band jazz album of 1973 . \" Woody Herman was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987 .",

Herman liked what drew many artists to Columbia , Liederkranz Hall , at the time the best recording venue in New York City . The first side Herman recorded was \" Laura \" , the theme song of the 1944 movie of the same name . Herman ' s version was so successful that it made Columbia hold from release the arrangement that Harry James had recorded days earlier . The Columbia contract coincided with a change in the band ' s repertoire . The 1944 group , which he called the First Herd , was famous for its progressive jazz . The First Herd ' s music was heavily influenced by Duke Ellington and Count Basie . Its lively , swinging arrangements , combining bop themes with swing rhythm parts , were greatly admired . As of February 1945 the personnel included Bill Harris , Sonny Berman , Pete Candoli , Billy Bauer ( later replaced by Chuck Wayne ) , Ralph Burns , Davey Tough and Flip Phillips . On February 26 , 1945 in New York City , the Woody Herman band recorded \" Caldonia \" . Neal Hefti and Ralph Burns collaborated on the arrangement of \" Caldonia \" that the Herman band used . \" Ralph caught Louis Jordan [ singing \" Caldonia \" ] in an act and wrote the opening twelve bars and the eight bar tag . \" \" But the most amazing thing on the record was a soaring eight bar passage by trumpets near the end . \" These eight measures have wrongly been attributed to a Gillespie solo , but were in fact originally written by Neal Hefti . George T. Simon compares Hefti with Gillespie in a 1944 review for Metronome magazine saying , \" Like Dizzy [ ... ] , Hefti has an abundance of good ideas , with which he has aided Ralph Burns immensely \" . In 1946 the band won Down Beat , Metronome , Billboard and Esquire polls for best band , nominated by their peers in the big band business . Along with the high acclaim for their jazz and blues performances , classical composer Igor Stravinsky wrote the Ebony Concerto , one in a series of compositions commissioned by Herman with solo clarinet , for this band .

Known for her fierce independence and spirited personality , Hepburn was a leading lady in Hollywood for more than 60 years . She appeared in a range of genres , from screwball comedy to literary drama , and she received four Academy Awards for Best Actress \u2013 a record for any performer . In 1999 , Hepburn was named by the American Film Institute as the greatest female star of Classic Hollywood Cinema . Raised in Connecticut by wealthy , progressive parents , Hepburn began to act while studying at Bryn Mawr College . After four years in the theatre , favorable reviews of her work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood . Her early years in the film industry were marked with success , including an Academy Award for her third picture , Morning Glory ( 1933 ) , but this was followed by a series of commercial failures which led her to be labeled \" box office poison \" in 1938 . Hepburn masterminded her own comeback , buying out her contract with RKO Radio Pictures and acquiring the film rights to The Philadelphia Story , which she sold on the condition that she be the star . In the 1940s , she was contracted to Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer , where her career focused on an alliance with Spencer Tracy . The screen - partnership spanned 25 years and produced nine movies . Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life , as she regularly appeared in Shakespearean stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles . She found a niche playing middle - aged spinsters , such as in The African Queen ( 1951 ) , a persona the public embraced . Three more Oscars came for her work in Guess Who ' s Coming to Dinner ( 1967 ) , The Lion in Winter ( 1968 ) , and On Golden Pond ( 1981 ) . In the 1970s , she began appearing in television films , which became the focus of her career in later life . She remained active into old age , making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87 . After a period of inactivity and ill health , Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96 .",

She was outspoken , assertive , athletic , and wore trousers before it was fashionable for women to do so . She married once , as a young woman , but thereafter lived independently . A 26 - year affair with her co - star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public . With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen , Hepburn epitomized the \" modern woman \" in the 20th - century United States and is remembered as an important cultural figure . Early life and education Hepburn was born in Hartford , Connecticut , on May 12 , 1907 , the second of six children . Her parents were Thomas Norval Hepburn ( 1879 \u2013 1962 ) , a urologist at Hartford Hospital , and Katharine Martha Houghton ( 1878 \u2013 1951 ) , a feminist campaigner . Both parents fought for social change in the US : Thomas Hepburn helped establish the New England Social Hygiene Association , which educated the public about venereal disease , while the elder Katharine headed the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association and later campaigned for birth control with Margaret Sanger . As a child , Hepburn joined her mother on several \" Votes For Women \" demonstrations . The Hepburn children were raised to exercise freedom of speech and encouraged to think and debate on any topic they wished . Her parents were criticized by the community for their progressive views , which stimulated Hepburn to fight against barriers she encountered . Hepburn said she realized from a young age that she was the product of \" two very remarkable parents \" , and credited her \" enormously lucky \" upbringing with providing the foundation for her success . She remained close to her family throughout her life .",

She did not work again until 1967 ' s Guess Who ' s Coming to Dinner , her ninth film with Tracy . The movie dealt with the subject of interracial marriage , with Hepburn ' s niece , Katharine Houghton , playing her daughter . Tracy was dying by this point , suffering the effects of heart disease , and Houghton later commented that her aunt was \" extremely tense \" during the production . Tracy died 17 days after filming his last scene . Guess Who ' s Coming to Dinner was a triumphant return for Hepburn and her most commercially successful picture to that point . She won her second Best Actress Award at the Oscars , 34 years after winning her first . Hepburn felt the award was not just for her , but was also given to honor Tracy . Hepburn quickly returned to acting after Tracy ' s death , choosing to preoccupy herself as a remedy against grief . She received numerous scripts and chose to play Eleanor of Aquitaine in The Lion in Winter ( 1968 ) , a part she called \" fascinating \" . She read extensively in preparation for the role , in which she starred opposite Peter O ' Toole . Filming took place in Montmajour Abbey in the south of France , an experience she loved despite being \u2013 according to director Anthony Harvey \u2013 \" enormously vulnerable \" throughout . John Russell Taylor of The Times suggested that Eleanor was \" the performance of her ... career \" , and proved that she was \" a growing , developing , still surprising actress \" . The movie was nominated in all the major categories at the Academy Awards , and for the second year running Hepburn won the Oscar for Best Actress ( shared with Barbra Streisand for Funny Girl ) . The role , combined with her performance in Guess Who ' s Coming to Dinner , also received a British Academy Film Award ( BAFTA ) for Best Actress . Hepburn ' s next appearance was in The Madwoman of Chaillot ( 1969 ) , which she filmed in Nice immediately after completing The Lion in Winter . The picture was a failure critically and financially , and reviews targeted Hepburn for giving a misguided performance .",

Golf became a passion of Katharine ' s ; she took daily lessons and became very adept , reaching the semi - final of the Connecticut Young Women ' s Golf Championship . She loved swimming in Long Island Sound , and took ice - cold baths every morning in the belief that \" the bitterer the medicine , the better it was for you . \" Hepburn was a fan of movies from a young age , and went to see one every Saturday night .

On April 3 , 1921 , while visiting friends in Greenwich Village , Hepburn discovered the body of her adored older brother , Tom , dead from an apparent suicide . He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself . The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom ' s death must have been an experiment that had gone wrong . The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous , moody , and suspicious of people . She shied away from other children , dropped out of Oxford School , and began receiving private tutoring . For many years she used Tom ' s birthday ( November 8 ) as her own . It was not until her 1991 autobiography , Me : Stories of My Life , that Hepburn revealed her true birth date . In 1924 Hepburn gained a place at Bryn Mawr College . She attended the institution primarily to satisfy her mother , who had studied there , and recalled disliking the experience .

She struggled with the scholastic demands of university , and once was suspended for smoking in her room . Hepburn was drawn to acting , but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades . Once her marks had improved , she began performing regularly .

It was the last of ten films Hepburn made with George Cukor , and gained her a third Emmy nomination . By the 1980s , Hepburn had developed a noticeable tremor , giving her a permanently shaking head . She did not work for two years , saying in a television interview , \" I ' ve had my day \u2013 let the kids scramble and sweat it out . \" During this period she saw the Broadway production of On Golden Pond , and was impressed by its depiction of an elderly married couple coping with the difficulties of old age . Jane Fonda had purchased the screen rights for her father , actor Henry Fonda , and Hepburn sought to play opposite him in the role of quirky Ethel Thayer . On Golden Pond was a success , the second - highest grossing film of 1981 . It demonstrated how energetic the 74 - year - old Hepburn was , as she dived fully clothed into Squam Lake and gave a lively singing performance . The movie won her a second BAFTA and a record fourth Academy Award . Homer Dickens , in his book on Hepburn , notes that it was widely considered a sentimental win , \" a tribute to her enduring career . \"",

The day after graduating , she traveled to Baltimore to meet Edwin H. Knopf , who ran a successful stock theatre company . Impressed by her eagerness , Knopf cast Hepburn in his current production , The Czarina . She received good reviews for her small role , and the Printed Word described her performance as \" arresting \" . She was given a part in the following week ' s show , but her second performance was less well received . She was criticized for her shrill voice , and so left Baltimore to study with a voice tutor in New York City . Knopf decided to produce The Big Pond in New York and appointed Hepburn the understudy to the leading lady . A week before opening , the lead was fired and replaced with Hepburn , which gave her a starring role only four weeks into her theatre career . On opening night , she turned up late , mixed her lines , tripped over her feet , and spoke too quickly to be comprehensible . She was immediately fired , and the original leading lady rehired . Undeterred , Hepburn joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted the role of a schoolgirl in These Days . Her Broadway debut came on November 12 , 1928 , at the Cort Theatre , but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights . Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry ' s play Holiday . In early December , after only two weeks , she quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith , a college acquaintance . She planned to leave the theatre behind , but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in Holiday , which she held for six months .",

It was first recorded By Sammy Ambrose on Musicor # 1061 , then by Gary Lewis & the Playboys on Liberty # 55756 . Lewis ' s version charted first , # 101 on the January 2 , 1965 Billboard \" Bubbling Under \" chart . Both versions charted on January 9 , Lewis still at # 101 and Ambrose at # 117 . Ambrose dropped off the charts at that point , but Lewis made # 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the next week ( January 16 ) and his version continued to climb until it reached # 1 on February 20 , 1965 . Gary Lewis & the Playboys version None of the Playboys played their instruments on the hit recording and Lewis ' s vocals were heavily supported by Ron Hicklin ' s overdubs . The music was performed by members of The Wrecking Crew . The session drummer was Hal Blaine , Carol Kaye played bass and Leon Russell both played keyboards and arranged the music . The song was produced by Snuff Garrett . Stylistically , the song ' s recording features the then common \" basic ' combo ' instrumentation ... ( electric guitar , organ , bass , drums ) , modal ( dorian ) inflections in the harmony and melody of the verse and a basic rock beat pattern . \" Unusually the chorus features timpani and the transition between verse and chorus creates a daring modulation from C minor ( dorian ) to G - flat major . \" The musical style , \" writes Brackett , \" skims aspects from contemporary rock songs , and is then produced and arranged from the vantage point of ' easy - listening ' music . \" The song ' s harmonic progression resembles those of Beatles songs such as the G - flat / F / E - flat / D - flat descending bass line ( \" Bad to Me \" ) and the vi - iii movement ( \" Please Please Me , \" \" I Want to Hold Your Hand , \" \" She Loves You , \" \" And I Love Her , \" and others ) . The melodic turn on \" true \" of \" if you find someone whose heart is true \" resembles those in \" Please Please Me \" ( \" Last night I said these words to my girl \" ) and \" Do You Want to Know a Secret \" ( \" nobody knows , just we two \" ) .",

An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere , which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe . The Chernobyl disaster was the worst nuclear power plant accident in history in terms of cost and casualties . It is one of only two classified as a level 7 event ( the maximum classification ) on the International Nuclear Event Scale , the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011 . The struggle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles . During the accident itself , 31 people died , and long - term effects such as cancers are still being investigated . Overview The disaster began during a systems test on 26 April 1986 at reactor number four of the Chernobyl plant , which is near the city of Pripyat and in proximity to the administrative border with Belarus and the Dnieper River . There was a sudden and unexpected power surge , and when an emergency shutdown was attempted , a much larger spike in power output occurred , which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions . These events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air , causing it to ignite . The resulting fire sent a plume of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area , including Pripyat . The plume drifted over large parts of the western Soviet Union and Europe . From 1986 to 2000 , 350,400 people were evacuated and resettled from the most severely contaminated areas of Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine . According to official post - Soviet data , about 60 % of the fallout landed in Belarus .",

The book , however , has failed the peer review process . Of the five reviews published in the academic press , four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory , and one praised it while noting some shortcomings . The review by M. I. Balonov published by the New York Academy of Sciences concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader . It characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science . The accident raised concerns about nuclear power worldwide and slowed or reversed the expansion of nuclear power stations . The accident also raised concerns about the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry , slowing its expansion for a number of years and forcing the Soviet government to become less secretive about its procedures . \" No one believed the first newspaper reports , which patently understated the scale of the catastrophe and often contradicted one another . The confidence of readers was re - established only after the press was allowed to examine the events in detail without the original censorship restrictions . The policy of openness ( glasnost ) and ' uncompromising criticism ' of outmoded arrangements had been proclaimed back at the 27th Congress ( of KPSS ) , but it was only in the tragic days following the Chernobyl disaster that glasnost began to change from an official slogan into an everyday practice . The truth about Chernobyl that eventually hit the newspapers opened the way to a more truthful examination of other social problems . More and more articles were written about drug abuse , crime , corruption and the mistakes of leaders of various ranks . A wave of ' bad news ' swept over the readers in 1986 \u2013 87 , shaking the consciousness of society .

The test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown . No detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated , so the test program was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor ( NIKIET ) or the scientific manager . Instead , it was approved only by the director of the plant ( and even this approval was not consistent with established procedures ) . According to the test parameters , the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than 700 MW at the start of the experiment . If test conditions had been as planned , the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely ; the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started , which was inconsistent with approved procedure . The Chernobyl power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first 60 \u2013 75 seconds of a total loss of electric power , and thus lacked an important safety feature . The station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity , which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose , and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the Soviet nuclear oversight regulator ( even though there was a representative at the complex of 4 reactors ) . \" The mere fact that the operators were carrying out an experiment that had not been approved by higher officials indicates that something was wrong with the chain of command .

A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency examines the environmental consequences of the accident . Another UN agency , UNSCEAR , has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident \" equivalent on average to 21 additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation \" ; individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed , including 530,000 local recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra 50 years of typical natural background radiation exposure each . Estimates of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously ; disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify mortality \u2013 whether the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide , and whether the deaths are immediate , short term , or long term . Thirty - one deaths are directly attributed to the accident , all among the reactor staff and emergency workers . An UNSCEAR report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at 64 as of 2008 . The Chernobyl Forum predicts the eventual death toll could reach 4,000 among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation ( 200,000 emergency workers , 116,000 evacuees and 270,000 residents of the most contaminated areas ) ; this figure is a total causal death toll prediction , combining the deaths of approximately 50 emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome , nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of 3940 deaths from radiation - induced cancer and leukemia . In a peer - reviewed publication in the International Journal of Cancer in 2006 , the authors ( following a different conclusion methodology to the Chernobyl Forum study , which arrived at the total predicted death toll of 4,000 after cancer survival rates were factored in ) stated , without entering into a discussion on deaths , that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident : Also based upon extrapolations from the linear no - threshold model of radiation induced damage , down to zero , the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that , among the hundreds of millions of people living in broader geographical areas , there will be 50,000 excess cancer cases resulting in 25,000 excess cancer deaths . For this broader group , the 2006 TORCH report , commissioned by the European Greens political party , predicts 30,000 to 60,000 excess cancer deaths . The environmental advocacy group Greenpeace reports the figure at 200,000 or more .",

The exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope , requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis . Residual radioactivity in the environment Rivers , lakes and reservoirs The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the Pripyat River , which feeds into the Dnieper reservoir system , one of the largest surface water systems in Europe , which at the time supplied water to Kiev ' s 2.4 million residents , and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred . The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident.Chernobyl : Catastrophe and Consequences , Springer , Berlin ISBN 3 - 540 - 23866 - 2 In the most affected areas of Ukraine , levels of radioactivity ( particularly from radionuclides 131I , 137Cs and 90Sr ) in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident , though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom \" in an insoluble phase \" and would not dissolve for 800 \u2013 1000 years . Guidelines for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to 3,700 Bq / L , allowing most water to be reported as safe , and a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the Chernobyl plant ' s cooling pond was within acceptable norms . Despite this , two months after the disaster the Kiev water supply was abruptly switched from the Dnieper to the Desna River . Meanwhile , massive silt traps were constructed , along with an enormous 30m - deep underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the Pripyat River . Bio - accumulation of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations ( both in western Europe and in the former Soviet Union ) that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption . Guideline maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately 1000 Bq / kg in the European Union.EURATOM Council Regulations No . 3958 / 87 , No . 994 / 89 , No . 2218 / 89 , No . 770 / 90 In the Kiev Reservoir in Ukraine , concentrations in fish were several thousand Bq / kg during the years after the accident .",

                    "context": "On 26 April 1986 , at 01:23 ( UTC+3 ) , reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase , leading to explosions in its core . This dispersed large quantities of radioactive fuel and core materials into the atmosphere and ignited the combustible graphite moderator . The burning graphite moderator increased the emission of radioactive particles , carried by the smoke , as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel . The accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature , which took place during a normal shutdown procedure . Steam turbine tests In steady state operation , a significant fraction ( over 6 % ) of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products . This heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped ( e.g. , following an emergency SCRAM ) and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage . RBMK reactors like those at Chernobyl use water as a coolant . Reactor 4 at Chernobyl consisted of about 1,600 individual fuel channels ; each required a coolant flow of 28 metric tons ( 28000 l ) per hour . Since cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a SCRAM , in the event of a power grid failure , Chernobyl ' s reactors had three backup diesel generators ; these could start up in 15 seconds , but took 60 \u2013 75 seconds to attain full speed and reach the 5.5megawatt ( MW ) output required to run one main pump . To solve this one - minute gap , considered an unacceptable safety risk , it had been theorised that rotational energy from the steam turbine ( as it wound down under residual steam pressure ) could be used to generate the required electrical power . Analysis indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for 45 seconds , bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators . This capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally , and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully . An initial test carried out in 1982 indicated that the excitation voltage of the turbine - generator was insufficient ; it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip . The system was modified , and the test was repeated in 1984 but again proved unsuccessful . In 1985 , the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results . The test procedure would be repeated again in 1986 , and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of Reactor Four .",

                    "context": "There were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion . One view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen , which had been produced either by the overheated steam - zirconium reaction or by the reaction of red - hot graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide . Another hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core . A third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion . According to this version , the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop , causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure , that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam . This second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building . However , the sheer force of the second explosion , and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event , indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient ; the result of the melting core material , in the absence of its cladding , water coolant and moderator , undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon . This nuclear excursion released 40 billion joules of energy , the equivalent of about ten tons of TNT . The analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core . Contrary to safety regulations , bitumen , a combustible material , had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall . Ejected material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor 3 , which was still operating . It was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor 3 . Inside reactor 3 , the chief of the night shift , Yuri Bagdasarov , wanted to shut down the reactor immediately , but chief engineer Nikolai Fomin would not allow this . The operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working . At 05:00 , however , Bagdasarov made his own decision to shut down the reactor , leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems .

Conditions before the accident The conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of 25 April 1986 . The day shift workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures . A special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system . As planned , a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at 01:06 on 25 April , and the power level had reached 50 % of its nominal 3200 MW thermal level by the beginning of the day shift . At this point , another regional power station unexpectedly went offline , and the Kiev electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of Chernobyl ' s output be postponed , as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand . The Chernobyl plant director agreed , and postponed the test . Despite this delay , preparations for the test not affecting the reactor ' s power were carried out , including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or ECCS , a passive / active system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a loss - of - coolant accident . Given the other events that unfolded , the system would have been of limited use , but its disabling as a \" routine \" step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test . In addition , had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned , it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test . At 23:04 , the Kiev grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume . This delay had some serious consequences : the day shift had long since departed , the evening shift was also preparing to leave , and the night shift would not take over until midnight , well into the job . According to plan , the test should have been finished during the day shift , and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise shut - down plant .",

Bungee jumping ( ; also spelt \" bungy \" jumping , which is the usual spelling in New Zealand and several other countries ) is an activity that involves jumping from a tall structure while connected to a large elastic cord . The tall structure is usually a fixed object , such as a building , bridge or crane ; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object , such as a hot - air - balloon or helicopter , that has the ability to hover above the ground . The thrill comes from the free - falling and the rebound . When the person jumps , the cord stretches and the jumper flies upwards again as the cord recoils , and continues to oscillate up and down until all the kinetic energy is dissipated . History The first modern bungee jumps were made on 1 April 1979 from the 250 ft Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol , by David Kirke and Simon Keeling , both members of the Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club . The jumpers were arrested shortly after , but continued with jumps in the US from the Golden Gate Bridge and the Royal Gorge Bridge ( this last jump sponsored by and televised on the American programme That ' s Incredible ) , spreading the concept worldwide . By 1982 , they were jumping from mobile cranes and hot air balloons . Organised commercial bungee jumping began with the New Zealander , A J Hackett , who made his first jump from Auckland ' s Greenhithe Bridge in 1986 . During the following years , Hackett performed a number of jumps from bridges and other structures ( including the Eiffel Tower ) , building public interest in the sport , and opening the world ' s first permanent commercial bungee site , the Kawarau Bridge Bungy at the Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge near Queenstown in the South Island of New Zealand . Hackett remains one of the largest commercial operators , with concerns in several countries .",

This safety record is attributable to bungee operators rigorously conforming to standards and guidelines governing jumps , such as double checking calculations and fittings for every jump . As with any sport , injuries can still occur ( see below ) , and there have been fatalities . A relatively common mistake in fatality cases is to use a cord that is too long . The cord should be substantially shorter than the height of the jumping platform to allow it room to stretch . When the cord becomes taut and then is stretched , the tension in the cord progressively increases . Initially the tension is less than the jumper ' s weight and the jumper continues to accelerate downwards . At some point , the tension equals the jumper ' s weight and the acceleration is temporarily zero . With further stretching , the jumper has an increasing upward acceleration and at some point has zero vertical velocity before recoiling upward . See also Potential energy for a discussion of the spring constant and the force required to distort bungee cords and other spring - like objects .

Bloukrans Bridge Bungy has been operated commercially by Face Adrenalin since 1997 , and is the highest commercial bridge bungy in the world .

The word \" bungee \" The word \" bungee \" originates from West Country dialect of English language , meaning \" Anything thick and squat \" , as defined by James Jennings in his book \" Observations of Some of the Dialects in The West of England \" published 1825 . Around 1930 , the name became used for a rubber eraser . Earlier tethered jumping The land diving ( Sa : ' ) of Pentecost Island in Vanuatu is an ancient ritual in which young men jump from tall wooden platforms with vines tied to their ankles as a test of their courage and passage into manhood . Unlike in modern bungee - jumping , land - divers intentionally hit the ground , but the vines absorb sufficient force to make the impact non - lethal . The land - diving ritual on Pentecost has been claimed as an inspiration by AJ Hackett , prompting calls from the islanders ' representatives for compensation for what they view as the unauthorised appropriation of their cultural property .",

It merely consists of , as the name suggests , running along a track ( often inflatable ) with a bungee cord attached . One often has a velcro - backed marker that marks how far the runner got before the bungee cord pulled back . This activity can often be found at fairs and carnivals and is often most popular with children . Ramp Bungee jumping off a ramp . Two rubber cords - the \" bungees \" - are tied around the participant ' s waist to a harness . Those bungee cords are linked to steel cables along which they can slide due to stainless pulleys . The participants bicycle , sled or ski before jumping . Suspended Catch Air Device SCAD diving is similar to bungee jumping in that the participant is dropped from a height , but in this variation there is no cord ; instead the participant falls into a net . Safety and possible injury Bungee jumping injuries may be divided into those that occur after jumping secondary to equipment mishap or tragic accident , and those that occur regardless of safety measures . In the first instance , injury can happen if the safety harness fails , the cord length is miscalculated , or the cord is not properly connected to the jump platform . In 1986 , Michael Lush died of multiple injuries after bungee jumping for a stunt on a BBC television programme and in 1997 Laura Patterson , one of a 16 - member professional bungee jumping team , died of massive cranial trauma when she jumped from the top level of the Louisiana Superdome and collided head - first into the concrete - based playing field . She was practicing for an exhibition intended to be performed during the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXI . In 2002 , Chris Thomas died after his harness tore off during a charity jump in Swansea , Wales : it was later claimed that the harness was not safe for his weight . On New Year ' s Eve 2011 , Erin Langworthy , an Australian woman was plunged into the Zambezi River at Victoria Falls , where she nearly drowned with her feet still tied together after her bungee rope snapped during a jump . Matthew E. Coleman , a 21 - year - old man from Maryland , died at an Adventure World bungee jump after slamming into the ground with a rope that was too long .",

                    "context": "A similar practice , only with a much slower pace for falling , has been practised as the Danza de los Voladores de Papantla or the ' Papantla flyers ' of central Mexico , a tradition dating back to the days of the Aztecs . A tower 4000 ft high with a system to drop a \" car \" suspended by a cable of \" best rubber \" was proposed for the Chicago World Fair , 1892 - 1893 . The car , seating two hundred people , would be shoved from a platform on the tower and then bounce to a stop . The designer engineer suggested that for safety the ground below \" be covered with eight feet of feather bedding \" . The proposal was declined by the Fair ' s organizers . Equipment The elastic rope first used in bungee jumping , and still used by many commercial operators , is factory - produced braided shock cord . This special bungee cord consists of many latex strands enclosed in a tough outer cover . The outer cover may be applied when the latex is pre - stressed , so that the cord ' s resistance to extension is already significant at the cord ' s natural length . This gives a harder , sharper bounce . The braided cover also provides significant durability benefits . Other operators , including A. J. Hackett and most southern - hemisphere operators , use unbraided cords with exposed latex strands . These give a softer , longer bounce and can be home - produced . Accidents where participants became detached led many commercial operators to use a body harness , if only as a backup for an ankle attachment . Body harnesses generally derive from climbing equipment rather than parachute equipment . The highest jump In August 2005 , AJ Hackett added a SkyJump to the Macau Tower , making it the world ' s highest jump at 233 m. The SkyJump did not qualify as the world ' s highest bungee as it is not strictly speaking a bungee jump , but instead what is referred to as a ' Decelerator - Descent ' jump , using a steel cable and decelerator system , rather than an elastic rope . On 17 December 2006 , the Macau Tower started operating a proper bungee jump , which became the \" Highest Commercial Bungee Jump In The World \" according to the Guinness Book of Records . The Macau Tower Bungy has a \" Guide cable \" system that limits swing ( the jump is very close to the structure of the tower itself ) but does not have any effect on the speed of descent , so this still qualifies the jump for the World Record .",

Eyesight damage is the most frequently reported complication . Impaired eyesight secondary to retinal haemorrhage may be transient or take several weeks to resolve . In one case , a 26 - year - old woman ' s eyesight was still impaired after 7 months . Whiplash injuries may occur as the jumper is jolted on the bungee cord and in at least one case , this has led to quadriplegia secondary to a broken neck . Very serious injury can also occur if the jumper ' s neck or body gets entangled in the cord . More recently , carotid artery dissection leading to a type of stroke after bungee jumping has also been described . All of these injuries have occurred in fit and healthy people in their twenties and thirties . Bungee jumping has also been shown to increase stress and decrease immune function . In popular culture Several major movies have featured bungee jumps , most famously the opening sequence of the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye in which Bond makes a jump over the edge of a dam in Russia ( in reality the dam is in Switzerland : Verzasca Dam , and the jump was genuine , not an animated special effect ) . The jump in the dam later makes an appearance as a Roadblock task in the 14th season of the reality competition series The Amazing Race . A fictional proto - bungee jump is a hawiian point in the Michael Chabon novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay . In the film Selena , in which Jennifer Lopez plays Selena Quintanilla - Perez , her character is shown bungee jumping at a carnival . This actual event took place shortly before Selena ' s murder on March 31 , 1995 . In the medical drama television series Scrubs episode \" My first step \" , characters John Dorian and Elliot Reid bungee jump after he realizes he does n ' t take risks often enough .",

This jump , made without guide ropes , is from the top of the Verzasca Dam near Locarno , Switzerland . It appears in the opening scene of the James Bond film GoldenEye . The Bloukrans Bridge Bungy in South Africa and the Verzasca Dam jumps are pure freefall swinging bungee from a single cord . Guinness only records jumps from fixed objects to guarantee the accuracy of the measurement . John Kockleman however recorded a 2200 ft bungee jump from a hot air balloon in California in 1989 . In 1991 Andrew Salisbury jumped from 9000 ft from a helicopter over Cancun for a television program and with Reebok sponsorship . The full stretch was recorded at 3157 ft . He landed safely under parachute . One commercial jump higher than all others is at the Royal Gorge Bridge in Colorado . The height of the platform is 321 m. However , this jump is rarely available , as part of the Royal Gorge Go Fast Games \u2013 first in 2005 , then again in 2007 . Previous to this the record was held in West Virginia , USA , by New Zealander Chris Allum , who bungee jumped 823 ft ( 251m ) from the New River Gorge Bridge on \" Bridge Day \" 1992 to set a world ' s record for the longest bungee jump from a fixed structure . Variations Catapult In \" Catapult \" ( Reverse Bungee or Bungee Rocket ) the ' jumper ' starts on the ground . The jumper is secured and the cord is stretched , then released and shooting the jumper up into the air . This is often achieved using either a crane or a hoist attached to a ( semi - ) perma structure . This simplifies the action of stretching the cord and later lowering the participant to the ground . Trampoline \" Bungy Trampoline \" uses , as its name suggests , elements from bungy and trampolining . The participant begins on a trampoline and is fitted into a body harness , which is attached via bungy cords to two high poles on either side of the trampoline . As they begin to jump , the bungy cords are tightened , allowing a higher jump than could normally be made from a trampoline alone . Running",

His eighteen - year term as General Secretary was second only to that of Joseph Stalin in duration . During Brezhnev ' s rule , the global influence of the Soviet Union grew dramatically , in part because of the expansion of the Soviet military during this time . His tenure as leader was marked by the beginning of an era of economic and social stagnation in the Soviet Union . Brezhnev was born in Kamianske into a Russian worker ' s family . After graduating from the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum , he became a metallurgical engineer in the iron and steel industry , in Ukraine . He joined Komsomol in 1923 , and in 1929 became an active member of the CPSU . He was drafted into immediate military service during World War II and left the army in 1946 with the rank of major general . In 1952 Brezhnev became a member of the Central Committee , and during 1964 , Brezhnev succeeded Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary , while Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his post as Soviet premier . As a leader , Brezhnev took care to consult his colleagues before acting , but his attempt to govern without meaningful economic reforms led to a national decline by the mid - 1970s , a period referred to as the Era of Stagnation . A significant increase in military expenditure , which by the time of Brezhnev ' s death stood at approximately 12.5 % of the country ' s GNP , and an aging and ineffective leadership set the stage for a dwindling GNP compared to Western nations . While at the helm of the USSR , Brezhnev pushed for d\u00e9tente between the Eastern and Western countries . At the same time he presided over the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia to stop the Prague Spring , and he sent the Soviet military to Afghanistan in an attempt to save the fragile regime , which was fighting a war against the mujahideen . However , in December 1981 he decided not to militarily intervene in Poland , instead allowing the country ' s government to impose martial law , and effectively marking the end of the Brezhnev Doctrine .",

The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the equivalent to a First World Prime Minister , while the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was equivalent to the office of the President . In the Soviet Union ' s seventy - year history there was no official leader of the Soviet Union offices but a Soviet leader usually led the country through the office of the Premier and / or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) . In the ideology of Vladimir Lenin the head of the Soviet state was a collegiate body of the vanguard party ( see What Is to Be Done ? ) . Following Joseph Stalin ' s consolidation of power in the 1920s the post of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party became synonymous with ' Leader of the Soviet Union ' because the post controlled both the CPSU and the Soviet Government . The post of the General Secretary was abolished under Stalin and later re - established by Nikita Khrushchev under the name of First Secretary ; in 1966 Leonid Brezhnev reverted the office title to its former name . Being the head of the communist party , the office of the General Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990 . The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession , so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader , the successor usually needed the support of the Politburo , the Central Committee , or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power .

Brezhnev ' s patron Khrushchev succeeded Stalin as General Secretary , while Khrushchev ' s opponent Malenkov succeeded Stalin as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet . Brezhnev sided with Khrushchev against Malenkov , but only for several years . On 7 May 1955 , Brezhnev was made General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR . On the surface , his brief was simple : to make the new lands agriculturally productive . In reality , Brezhnev became involved in the development of the Soviet missile and nuclear arms programs , including the Baykonur Cosmodrome . The initially successful Virgin Lands Campaign soon became unproductive and failed to solve the growing Soviet food crisis . Brezhnev was recalled to Moscow in 1956 . The harvest in the years following the Virgin Lands Campaign was disappointing , which would have hurt his political career had he remained in Kazakhstan . In February 1956 , Brezhnev returned to Moscow , was made candidate member of the Politburo assigned in control of the defense industry , the space program including the Baykonur Cosmodrome , heavy industry , and capital construction .

Brezhnev had fostered a cult of personality , although not nearly to the same degree as Stalin . Mikhail Gorbachev , who would lead the USSR from 1985 to 1991 , denounced his legacy and drove the process of liberalisation of the Soviet Union . In spite of this , opinion polls in Russia show Brezhnev to be the most popular Russian leader of the 20th century . Early life and career Origins and education Brezhnev was born on 19 December 1906 in Kamianske in Ukraine ) , to metalworker Ilya Yakovlevich Brezhnev and his wife , Natalia Denisovna Mazalova . His parents used to live in Brezhnevo ( Kursky District , Kursk Oblast , Russia ) before moving to Kamenskoe . Brezhnev ' s ethnicity was specified as Ukrainian in some documents , including his passport , and Russian in others . Like many youths in the years after the Russian Revolution of 1917 , he received a technical education , at first in land management where he started as a land surveyor and then in metallurgy . He graduated from the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum in 1935 and became a metallurgical engineer in the iron and steel industries of eastern Ukraine . Political development Brezhnev joined the Communist Party youth organisation , the Komsomol , in 1923 , and the Party itself in 1929 . In 1935 and 1936 , Brezhnev served his compulsory military service , and after taking courses at a tank school , he served as a political commissar in a tank factory . Later in 1936 , he became director of the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum ( technical college ) . In 1936 , he was transferred to the regional center of Dnipropetrovsk and , in 1939 , he became Party Secretary in Dnipropetrovsk , in charge of the city ' s important defence industries . As a survivor of Stalin ' s Great Purge of 1937 \u2013 39 , he was able to advance quickly as the purges created numerous openings in the senior and middle ranks of the Party and state governments . World War II When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 , Brezhnev was , like most middle - ranking Party officials , immediately drafted . He worked to evacuate Dnipropetrovsk ' s industries to the east of the Soviet Union before the city fell to the Germans on 26 August , and then was assigned as a political commissar . In October , Brezhnev was made deputy of political administration for the Southern Front , with the rank of Brigade - Commissar ( Colonel ) .",

His policy of de - Stalinisation earned him many enemies within the party , especially from old Stalinist appointees . Many saw this approach as destructive and destabilising . A group known as Anti - Party Group tried , but failed , to oust Khrushchev from office in 1957 . As Khrushchev grew older , his erratic behavior became worse , usually making decisions without discussing or confirming them with the Politburo . Leonid Brezhnev , a close companion of Khrushchev , was elected First Secretary the same day of Khrushchev ' s removal from power ; Alexei Kosygin became the new Premier and Anastas Mikoyan kept his office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet . In 1965 , on the orders of the Politburo , Mikoyan was forced to retire ; Nikolai Podgorny took over the office of Chairman of the Presidium . The USSR in the post - Khrushchev 1960s was governed by a collective leadership . Henry A. Kissinger , the American National Security Advisor , mistakenly believed that Kosygin was the ' Leader of the Soviet Union and that he was at the helm of ' Soviet foreign policy ' because he represented the Soviet Union at the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference . The \" Era of Stagnation \" , a derogatory term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev , was a period marked by low socio - economic efficiency in the country and a gerontocracy ruling the country . Yuri Andropov succeeded Brezhnev in his post as General Secretary in 1982 . In 1983 Andropov was hospitalised , and rarely met up at work to chair the politburo meetings due to his declining health . Nikolai Tikhonov usually chaired the meetings in his place . Following Andropov ' s death , an even older leader , Konstantin Chernenko was elected to the General Secretariat . His rule lasted for little more than a year . Gorbachev was elected to the General Secretariat by the Politburo on 11 March 1985 . By the mid - to - late 1980s Gorbachev had launched the policies of perestroika ( literally meaning \" reconstruction \" , but varies ) and glasnost ( \" openness \" and \" transparency \" ) . The dismantling of the principal defining features of communism in 1988 and 1989 in the Soviet Union led to the unintended consequence of breaking - up the Soviet state into 15 successor states after the failed August Coup of 1991 led by Gennady Yanayev .

A union of multiple subnational Soviet republics , its government and economy were highly centralized . The Soviet Union was a one - party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital . The Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917 , when the Bolsheviks , headed by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the provisional government that had replaced the Tsar . They established the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic ( renamed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1936 ) , beginning a civil war between the revolutionary \" Reds \" and the counter - revolutionary \" Whites . \" The Red Army entered several territories of the former Russian Empire and helped local Communists take power through soviets , which nominally acted on behalf of workers and peasants . In 1922 , the Communists were victorious , forming the Soviet Union with the unification of the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian , and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin ' s death in 1924 , a troika and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid - 1920s . Stalin suppressed all political opposition to his rule , committed the state ideology to Marxism \u2013 Leninism ( which he created ) , and initiated a centrally planned economy . As a result , the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization which laid the foundation for its victory in World War II and post - war dominance of Eastern Europe . Stalin also fomented political paranoia , and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his from the Communist Party through the mass arbitrary arrest of many people ( military leaders , Communist Party members , and ordinary citizens alike ) who were then sent to correctional labor camps or sentenced to death . At the beginning of World War II , Stalin signed a non - aggression pact with Nazi Germany ; the treaty delayed confrontation between the two countries . In June 1941 the Germans invaded , opening the largest and bloodiest theater of war in history . Soviet war casualties accounted for the highest proportion of the conflict in the cost of acquiring the upper hand over Axis forces at intense battles such as Stalingrad . Soviet forces eventually captured Berlin in 1945 . The territory overtaken by the Red Army became satellite states of the Eastern Bloc . The Cold War emerged in 1947 as the Soviet bloc confronted the Western states that united in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949 .",

Upon death , resignation , or removal from office of an incumbent President , the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office , though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested . After the failed August Coup the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the State Council of the Soviet Union . Summary Vladimir Lenin was voted the Chairman of the Council of People ' s Commissars of the USSR ( Sovnarkom ) on 30 December 1922 by the Congress of Soviets . His health , at the age of 53 , declined from effects of two bullet wounds , later aggravated by three strokes which culminated with his death in 1924 . Irrespective of his health status in his final days , Lenin was already losing much of his power to Stalin . Alexei Rykov succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the Sovnarkom , and although he was de jure the most powerful person in the country , the Politburo of the Communist Party began to overshadow the Sovnarkom in the mid - 1920s . By the end of the decade , Rykov merely rubber stamped the decisions predetermined by Stalin and the Politburo . Stalin ' s early policies pushed for rapid industrialisation , nationalisation of private industry and the collectivisation of private plots created under Lenin ' s New Economic Policy . As leader of the Politburo , Stalin consolidated near - absolute power by 1938 after the Great Purge , a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution . Nazi German troops invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , but were repulsed by the Soviets in December . On Stalin ' s orders , the USSR launched a counter - attack on Nazi Germany .

He was a team player and never acted rashly or hastily ; unlike Khrushchev , he did not make decisions without substantial consultation from his colleagues , and was always willing to hear their opinions . During the early 1970s , Brezhnev consolidated his domestic position . In 1977 , he forced the retirement of Podgorny and became once again Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union , making this position equivalent to that of an executive president . While Kosygin remained Premier until shortly before his death in 1980 ( replaced by Nikolai Tikhonov as Premier ) , Brezhnev was the dominant driving force of the Soviet Union from the mid - 1970s to his death in 1982 . Domestic policies Repression Brezhnev ' s stabilisation policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev , and clamping down on cultural freedom . During the Khrushchev years , Brezhnev had supported the leader ' s denunciations of Stalin ' s arbitrary rule , the rehabilitation of many of the victims of Stalin ' s purges , and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy . But as soon as he became leader , Brezhnev began to reverse this process , and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude . The trial of the writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky in 1966 \u2013 the first such public trials since Stalin ' s day \u2013 marked the reversion to a repressive cultural policy . Under Yuri Andropov the state security service ( in the form of the KGB ) regained some of the powers it had enjoyed under Stalin , although there was no return to the purges of the 1930s and 1940s , and Stalin ' s legacy remained largely discredited among the Soviet intelligentsia . By the mid - 1970s , there were an estimated 1,000 to 10,000 political and religious prisoners across the Soviet Union , living in grievous conditions and suffering from malnutrition . Many of these prisoners were considered by the Soviet state to be mentally unfit and were hospitalised in mental asylums across the Soviet Union . Under Brezhnev ' s rule , the KGB infiltrated most , if not all , anti - government organisations , which ensured that there was little to no opposition against him or his power base . However , Brezhnev refrained from the all - out violence seen under the rule of Stalin . Economics Economic growth until 1973",
